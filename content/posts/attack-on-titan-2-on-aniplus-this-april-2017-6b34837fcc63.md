_Hello, everyone — I’ve been receiving letters from Aniplus about their latest offerings, which is kind of a waste since there is no easy way to watch the channel yet until the_ **_Tribe_** _app launched in the country (I will post my review of the app this Monday morning)._

**Aniplus** sent me an email last night announcing that they will simulcast **Attack on Titan 2** in April 2017 — it’s the continuation of the beloved apocalyptic series where humanity fights titans so they can break free from their confined walls (three of them) that were built to protect themselves.

_Hajime Isayama_’s manga of the same name has been adapted into a 24-episode series, two live-action movies, a parody manga (which got animated as well), a light novel series and two video games.

They’ll be announcing more details in the future, and I’ll let you know as soon as possible once I get their message. This will show up on Aniplus’ live streaming on the Tribe app but no details yet if it will be available as well on its on-demand section.

On a somehow-unrelated seiyuu note, I give you _this_. Happy Saturday from Manila!
