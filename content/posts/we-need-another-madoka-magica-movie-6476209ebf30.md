I’ve heard about the third **Madoka Magica** movie. I’ve read the synopsis. I even went too far by obtaining the so-called “camrip”. Then it all ends in one conclusion — “I don’t even…”

I’ve heard about the third **Madoka Magica** movie. I’ve read the synopsis. I even went too far by obtaining the so-called “camrip”. Then it all ends in one conclusion — “I don’t even…”

Sure, I’ve seen the transcripts and accounts of those who have watched the movie firsthand. Sure, some of them can’t even believe that that moment was in the plot. Sure, Chiwa Saito warned us during an interview about the movie…

…but I want to see why those who have seen the movie had a new monicker for our Homerun-chan.

For the record, based on the sources from the internet that I forgot to take note of, the series’ writer and all-around butcher **Gen Urobochi** was being nagged by the production committee to write another script after the success of the first two movies, then mentioned that this will be the last; that it should have ended with the former two. This means that the third movie is just an extra route.

But as I write this piece, I still believe that there should be a conclusion to this madness. I am still badly butthurt with what I’ve saw — although what I’ve seen can be applied to real life, since we just can’t accept bad things easily, the feeling just can’t get off me.

Madoka Magica should have Madoka Kaname on the spotlight, but even dating back to the TV series, I felt that she’s a main character that will turn into a supplementary characer because Homura’s on the spotlight — that’s probably the same case here.

The production committee just pointed the spotlight to Madoka for how many times only to be focused more on Homura. It’s like they’re using her more as a plot device rather than a main character.

We should’ve called this Homura Magica then.

But as I share a piece of my mind to them, do they have a better alternative? Can they do a plot in which the ending wouldn’t be that gloomy? I can’t say.

I’ve said all of these things to you, implying that this is enough; but I say unto you: We need another movie to fix the mess.

I’m sick of these guys giving more emphasis to Homura when the series is called “Puella Magi Madoka Magica.” Is it possible that we can have a “good route” story similar to what _OreImo_ did?

Can Madoka win, this time, against Homura? She has won once, and that was a great spectacle.

Either way, I presume that Madoka and Homura can’t be together — Urobochi has sealed the story to that of a yin-yang, so it’ll still be gloomy. Nevertheless, I am rooting for Team Madoka once a plan for a fourth movie became a reality.
