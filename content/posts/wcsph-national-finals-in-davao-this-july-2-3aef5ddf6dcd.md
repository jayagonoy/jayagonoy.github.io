Just in case you missed it, I wrote about the World Cosplay Summit Philippines’ National Finals which will be held this year in Davao.

I took the move to chat with our teams from NCR, and I’ve posted it on the web log. I hope that by at least sharing this to you, we will have a trace of what’s WCSPH in the metro, as it’s mostly promoted proactively in Mindanao, and I want to do my share of promoting it here in Manila.

I hope you will share this news to your friends as well. Many thanks.
