As I take a quick break, let me share you some of the series that I’m watching during commutes in and out of the office.

## Bakuon!

This has to be a must-watch anime for bike enthusiasts and people interested in owning a motorcycles, period, hands down. Also, Reina Ueda, Nao Touyama and Yumi Uchiyama are there. Hane’s (Ueda) cute.

I’ve just watched the third episode and I’m laughing my ass off with all that cliched stuff that I’ve read from light novels… wait, this is from GA Bunko, which is also the home of Rakudai. When will Rakudai have a second season?

I also cringed a bit with all of those fanservice since again I’m watching this during commute. _Hay_.

## Kuma Miko

Just focus on the bear, guys, he won’t bite — after all, he’s neutered.

## Macross Delta

This is actually the first time I’m going to watch a Macross series (I know I am missing out a lot but that’s fine), and I’m only there for Walkure. My first experience with Macross is though Zero-G Love (the downtempo version) and its funky guitar pluckings.
