**Events are back - and so, here we are.** The _keepsakes._ team is on and around again doing what we do best: Share stories together with our friends in the community. This time, we are visiting the **6200 Geek Con**, happening at the Southview Hotel in Brgy. Banilad, Dumaguete City on the weekend of June 11 and 12, 2022.

Organized by Karen J. A. Gumapac and Portia Bernadette N. Bation of Art Moves PH, and co-organized by the Silliman University Geek Culture Society, the 6200 Geek Con has a total of 10 exhibitors, [29 artist booths](https://www.facebook.com/SUGeekCultureSociety/posts/pfbid02e5C58a9aNX5bwnPhT7ojsLp2zLg3yauunB5FMY4gXYwuzkUvXuTN5ci1iX7ukSodl), and [two days of activities](https://www.facebook.com/SUGeekCultureSociety/posts/pfbid0V7MRtL9cbpuvrZy3GQyM4q8kHENxeg2kqXddq3mTvotAkq3gQZMx6mfXgUmYZ3wil) for the Negrense audience.

The Geek Con won't be complete without guests, and they brought in cosplayers **Ran Chii, Alan V., Ai Natsumi, Mais Semblante, and Diane**. Diane, Mais and Ranchii are well-known in Cebu's cosplay community, and Ai from Manila has made a name for herself over time. If there are Takodachis in Dumaguete, would you mind saying hi to Alan V. for us?
