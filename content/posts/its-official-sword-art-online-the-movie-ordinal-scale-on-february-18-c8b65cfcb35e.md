**ODEX Private Limited** has just officially confirmed (double redundancy intended for further emphasis — _confirmed na, official pa!_) that the Philippines will be able to see Sword Art Online the Movie: Ordinal Scale with the rest of the world as they updated the cover photo on the /ODEXanime Facebook page.

Prior to the official announcement, they already said that the Philippines will see it through SM Cinemas.

In addition, there will be an Official Japan Tour for the movie before the World Premiere, offered by H.I.S. in partnership with the movie and the World Cosplay Summit (Travel Bloggers/Reviewers can also try their luck by applying at the WCS website).
