...and why I'm cleaning up my content only to retain what I believe are the best ones.

I admit to my mistake of trusting people who will end up destroying my trust, so I will affirm my decision to let _keepsakes._ stay as a solo project. Any and all transactions on behalf of _keepsakes._ shall be done by me.

In the past I authorized Staff IDs to be used by my collaborators, but all of those are null and void - anyone who claims they're part of _keepsakes._ is not authorized to act on my behalf.

I am also making it clear that under my control, I am cleaning my content starting with video and podcast coverage, then photos and blogs. I've already started with my podcast.

By the end of this year, I expect my website to only move forward, feature my best solo works. This is to save digital space and to give respect to the ones I want to uplift.

Once I'm done with trimming content, I expect to change how my website looks. I am in control of my personal space and I expect to share only the handiwork I can be proud of.

I've already informed my Facebook friends to tag me if anyone on my friends list are acting badly and I'll see to it that they get cut off from my life.

To all friends and partners of _keepsakes._ who are sticking with me, thank you for your kind trust. I will do my best to be okay.
