For years, the ToyCon has been held at the SM Megatrade Halls, but this year, its organizer, the Asian Comics, Toys and Hobbies Collective, Inc. (ACTHCI) has decided to conquer all halls in the ground level of SMX Manila in Pasay, making it the biggest ToyCon yet.

## This is the 15th year of ToyCon

ToyCon’s been with us for fifteen years. Imagine, a small gathering of toy collectors have assembled to hold a small event somewhere in the metro, only to become one of the major events that fans look forward to every year.

### Hodor is Coming

As part of this year’s event, ToyCon has partnered with PopLife Entertainment to being the **POP! Life FanXperience** in Manila, the first one in Asia. Aside from artists such as Bronson Pellitier, Kiowa Gordon, Frankie J, and Mario Maurer, **Kristian Nairn** (who is well-known as Hodor from the hit series “Game of Thrones”) will be coming to Manila.

 Yes, Hodor is coming — no, don’t hold the excitement in your hearts. You know you want to see him up close.

## Big Exhibits coming through

As part of the POP! Life FanXperience, ToyCon will be bringing us the following exhibits:

- **Stan Lee’s Excelsior! Exhibit**, featuring his works from Marvel Comics,
- **Kotobukiya and Enesco Exhibit**, featuring figures from notable Japanese hobby shop Kotobukiya,
- The **Suicide Squad** Movie Exhibit,
- **POP! Life Exhibit**, featuring Funko POP! Vinyl Figures, and
- **The Voltes V 40th Anniversary Exhibit**, which is expected to be the tallest one (25 feet high) to be done inside ToyCon.

In addition, GMA Network’s **Encantadia 2016** will be at ToyCon as well! Not only that, this year’s event will have the biggest dealer floor, so if you think that last year’s exhibit is too small for you, wait until you see for yourself the biggest gathering of toy collectors, sellers and enthusiasts which makes ToyCon THE toy event of the year.

### CosFanX

Aside from the CosFanX Philippines Competition, there’s a lot of contests at ToyCon, and you can see them on the event’s official website, [www.toyconph.com](http://www.toyconph.com/).

This is the next level of the **Philippine Toys, Hobbies and Collectibles Convention** as it sails forth to become a world-class event, and we hope everyone joins us in being a part of another milestone in the making.

 **ToyCon 2016 will be held at Halls 1 to 4 of SMX Manila in Pasay City this June 10 to 12, 2016.** Tickets are on sale at SM Ticket outlets and online at [smtickets.com](https://smtickets.com/events/view/4473).
