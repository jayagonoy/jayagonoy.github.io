Our event at the Cebu Trade Hall has ended, and to cap off the night, I took a night stroll after we sort things out.

I took this while I’m waiting to cross the other side of Osmeña Boulevard, and if you see this in person, it’s beautiful — I guess it’s more gorgeous during the day.

Prior to this, I stumbled upon a resto called “Coffee Prince.” I think this was named after the hit Korean series.

[Last time, I tried Orange Brutus’ Breakfast Tocino](https://jayagonoy.com/i-tried-cebus-local-fastfood-for-a-change-e54ad3c09f31#.awd3dem0f), and now I tried their Spaghetti — this time, at their Fuente Osmeña branch. It’s delicious, and just enough for a stopover after walking kilometers or so.

_I’ll be coming back to Manila on Monday late night, so before that, I’m going to explore Cebu by day. I’m ecstatic to take photos already, as you may have noticed._
