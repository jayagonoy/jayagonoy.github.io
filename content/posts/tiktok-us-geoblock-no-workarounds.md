title: "If you didn't change your Tiktok region before the ban, it's best to wait things out"

So, the Tiktok ban is made in effect an hour before midnight. I wrote a story about how we're realizing the effect of this restriction on [VTuber NewsDrop](https://vtubernewsdrop.com/what-we-understand-about-the-tiktok-ban/).

What I regrettably didn't notice is that we can change regions in the account settings prior to the ban. That setting could have prevented us from being part of the affected accounts.

I tried other methods but I think Tiktok is compelled to stop everything for users in the US. Even if you get successful working around the geo-restrictions, there's no way you'd be able to change your Tiktok region now. It's best to wait things out until we're able to get back to our casual brainrot habit again.
