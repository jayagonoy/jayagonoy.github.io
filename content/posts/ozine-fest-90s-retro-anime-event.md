It's the first time I'm posting here on the site in a long while, so let me start the year right by sharing this video I did before the year ended—Ozine Fest 90s Retro Anime Event.

What kicked the Cosplay Week in the Philippines was a nostalgic, feel-good event. The dress code has set the tone for the event—90s Anime—and the cosplayers followed suit. Those who have complaints of seeing cosplays from a major game should have been here to relive their childhoods, as they will see only a few of such.

Understanding that the audio quality may not be at par with the rest of the videos, I still made sure that the audio is audible. That said, enjoy around 19 minutes of me asking cosplayers some questions or checking out the variety store.
