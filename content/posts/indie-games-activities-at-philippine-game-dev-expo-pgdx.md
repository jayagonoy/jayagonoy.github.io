**[Philippine Game Dev Expo or PGDX](https://jayagonoy.com/philippine-gamedev-expo-on-august-18-20/)** is set to gather gamers, game developers and people with similar interests under one roof through a showcase of amazing activities and wide business opportunities. Organizers CBZN Perspective and Game Developers Association of the Philippines are hopeful that this event—the first of its kind in the country—will spark more interest in game development.

## What's in it for Gamers and Developers at PGDX?

- PGDX co-presented by PLDT and SMART will have a business conference, B2B matching, an Indie Game Showcase and expo for Exhibitors and Artists throughout the weekend.

- Among the major partners for this event are [Taipei Game Show](https://tgs.tca.org.tw/index_2c_e.php) and Japan's [Bitsummit](https://bitsummit.org/en/about-2/) Indie Game Festival—if you are an indie game dev rooting for a global audience, now's the time to reach out to them at the PGDX.

- Academics (Meeting Room 2 and 3) and Professionals (Meeting Room 1) will also be treated to a series of discussions and knowledge-sharing activities—_click on each image below for the schedule_.
