You are preeeeety much aware of the ticket prices nowadays — Php100.00 is no longer a standard due to increasing costs of organizing events (this is what you call ‘inflation’). Since you’re among our valued Deremoe readers, you should know that we are keen on events — to the point of bashing them.

Moving on, we asked a question over at our Facebook page — “Will you spend more than Php150 for a ticket inside an event?”

Based on more or less 20 responses that we got as of this post, 93% of you agreed, while 3% of you implied that you don’t want to pay more for an event, or it depends on the situation.

Here’s some of the responses what we’d like to share with you.

Moving back to Adrian’s comment, if crowd filtering is the reason why ticket prices should increase, then it’s the organizers’ right to do so — one thing’s for sure, some of us still haven’t learned proper manners as we interact with people in events."

That’s just some responses that we have received as we asked that question, and more shall come soon.
