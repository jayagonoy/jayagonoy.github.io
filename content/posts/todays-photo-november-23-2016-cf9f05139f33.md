I took this photo at a secret socializing night at the BGC, and I can’t help but to wonder over this. This photo speaks “food is always the answer” or something like that.

_Tomorrow’s the last day of the Animahenasyon10 Conference, and I look forward to continuing my eventing at the ICITE Building this Saturday for TOEI Philippines’ 30th Anniversary Cosplay competition. I’ll make it a point to share the photos here before I get to Cebu. See ya!_
