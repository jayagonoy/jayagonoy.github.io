It has been a long while since a Wotagei competition appeared in Philippine soil post-pandemic, so Wotagei Pilipinas organized its own competition called Wotagei Taisen.

You can choose to participate in the event as a competing Wotageishi (dancer) or as an audience (spectator). As long as you are keen on learning the art of cyalume dance that originated from Japan's idol culture, you are welcome here.

Aside from the main competition to be judged by two-time Philippine representative to the Cyalume World Dance Battle Protektor, artists such as DJ Clarky Luna, Neko Fire (collaboration between Asfire and Nekonnect) and Sai Pingwinn will also take the stage.

Lompii and Sai will host the event and keep everyone's vibes in check. Tickets are available for Php230, and are only [available for purchase online](https://forms.gle/cEYGRyrEzzaFAxVz7). Enjoy Wotagei culture through this once-in-a-lifetime event.

Wotagei Taisen 2022 (Dance Battle Event) is all set this Saturday, November 26 from 1 to 5pm at Queen's Dance Studio in Mandaluyong City. _This event is presented by Wotagei Pilipinas._
