Dalawang linggo na since naganap yung PGDX sa SMX. Andami kong nagawa doon sa loob ng isa't kalahating araw:

- I took the time at the Expo's industry area and met with the representative of the Taipei Game Show (meron sila next year), Xsolla, International Esports Federation (IESF). Later on, I'll get back to them for _NewsDrop_.

- At the media area, I am introduced to the head of Malaysia's GamerBraves and the head of Todak Studios, Neo Todak.

- [Kachi of PC Worth](https://www.instagram.com/p/C94BZLAS9RS/) — the one and only — was present at the Expo floor... and so are the [several Dolias](https://www.instagram.com/p/C99Ien8yO_u/) at the Honor of Kings booth.

- I caught up with my good friends from Capriccioso Studio in Cebu at the Indie Game hall AND the Networking Night.

- I also met the game director of _[Until Then](https://untilthengame.com/)_, whom I secured a quick interview [for NewsDrop](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/JpvjAgqved0).

- Speaking of Networking Night, I took rounds talking to people at the latter hours of the night (over great food and bottomless iced tea).

- Last but not the least, I get to meet again my [friends in the community](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C93_9vJSGgy/) - some got selfies with me.

Another major activity is the announcement of ATLUS' _Metaphor: ReFantazio_ at the main stage on Day 2. [Too Much Gaming](https://www.toomuchgaming.net/blog-news/pgdx-2024-highlights-atlus-and-sega-takes-metaphor-refantazio-centerstage) has a good description of what has transpired there.

For the most part, I was able to take photos of the event and its activities:

I can point out three things about this year's event:

- **Malaysia.** It's not just Todak who's the only Malaysian brand coming to PGDX - I did mention [GamerBraves](https://www.gamerbraves.com/pgdx-2024-exclusive-snks-yasuyuki-oda-speaks-on-fighting-game-renaissance-and-fatal-fury-revival/) earlier, but I found out late that [The Magic Rain](https://themagicrain.com/2024/08/elevating-the-game-industry-at-the-philippine-game-development-expo-2024/) was also there. Both brands enjoy a market share in Malaysia.

- **Industry Relations.** Having several international brands at the industry lounge is great, because for someone like me who's keen to know more about statistics in related industries (like VTubing, of course it would be VTubing, my 100% bias).

- **Satisfaction.** The second PGDX is the next best thing in the country's pop culture event circuit after its supposed major competitor. It's the only major gaming event that has happened this year.
    - You got tournaments, the big game and tech showcases, the cosplays, the free hydration, on top of the workshops anchored by local and international speakers (I dropped by the workshop areas, one of them is clearly jam-packed).

This is my second time being invited to the PGDX — you can check [my entry from last year](https://jayagonoy.com/philippine-gamedev-expo-2023-event-report/) — and I would definitely look forward again to next year's activities.
