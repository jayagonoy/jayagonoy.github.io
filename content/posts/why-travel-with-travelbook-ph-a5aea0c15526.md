TravelBook.ph also comes up with various creative campaigns to promote local tourism such as the recently concluded #Juanderlust, an international competition where travelers all over the world participated to be the lucky “Chosen Juan” who will embark on an 80-day adventure to 80 places in the Philippines.

What’s left for me to do is to actually go book my vacation stay there (and I’m looking forward to see that happen either this year or next year).
