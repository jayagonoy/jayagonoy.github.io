**Fresh off the largely-attended second run of [Anime Fair](/ayala-malls-manila-bay-anime-fair-2023/) at Ayala Malls Manila Bay, the organizer reached out to _keepsakes._ to share their plans as well as to address some concerns within the ever-growing anime and cosplay community.**

**Dennis J. Uy**â€”some may remember him as GM Ukiya of Otakuzine, and _is definitely someone unique to the community_â€”leads Ozine Events, the organizer of [Ozine Fest](https://www.facebook.com/ozinefest), [Anime Fair](https://www.facebook.com/AnimeFair/), [Otaku Expo](https://www.facebook.com/OtakuExpo) and other related anime and cosplay events.

## Why there's an Anime Fair?

I didn't even know that Ozine would be organizing events in malls, because we've been accustomed to their events being organized at the SM Megatrade Halls. What's the reason behind building Anime Fair?

> **_It's our way of giving back to the community, since Anime and Cosplay events are for everyone; so they can enjoy the hobby. We know na some attendees, budgeted lang sila when it comes to anime events. Some struggle pa para sa ticket price, tapos pamasahe and food nila. By doing an open/free event, mas madaming pwede mag enjoy._**

We know that some attendees have a set budget when it comes to anime events. Some struggle for the ticket price, then they have to spend it on transport and food. By doing an open/free event, more people can enjoy.)

## Breaking Even?

During my prime time as a culture blogger, only a few people have the balls to openly share feedback with event organizers; but as the community grows, so are the people who are publicly curious if an event breaks even or not. When asked about whether an event profits, here's what the GM has to say:

> **_About naman sa profit, itâ€™s not how much or how big yung profit margins are. Exhibitors, artists alleys and merchant alleys also play a big role. Kaya sana sa attendees, support them as well by promoting their shops, and if may budget kayo, buy from them. ðŸ™‚_**

We've seen the Calendar of Events Ozine Fest and Otaku Expo has, but the question is this: Will there be another run of the Anime Fair? How long can Ozine keep up with providing events in open areas without ticketing?

> **_How long can we keep up on free events? As long as Anime and Cosplay Community is supporting us. In fact, Ozine Fest Summer will be a 3-part event, and it will be free as well. Gagawin namin siya sa Ayala Malls, proposed venue are Trinoma, Glorietta and Manila Bay. So, stay tuned for more updates!_**

**What a surprise.** Given the confidence the community has in building Anime Fair, they hope to branch that concept out and into more crowds. These details were only disclosed to keepsakes., and as of this writing we have yet to see if this plan becomes the real deal.

## What's Next in the Events Calendar?

In the next two weeks, the weekend of January 28-29, Otaku Expo's Anime & Manga Drawing Special will be held at SMX Manila with guest cosplayer Miu. We'll let Dennis share the rest of the events:

> **_Mini Ozine fest which is held last June of 2022 will be at SMX this year. Otaku Expo Tanabata Special will be on August 2023 at SM Megatrade Halls._**

As for the buzzkills in the crowd, the organizer is requesting one thing:

> _**Siguro request lang naman to keep Anime and Cosplay Fun and for everybody to enjoy. Respect the hobby and the people around them. Minsan may mistakes kami but we are always open to listen and do better. ðŸ™‚**_

**Thank you very much Dennis Uy of Ozine Events for reaching out to keepsakes.**
