It's just a few days before the return of the **Anime Idol Convention** (Also known as AICon)! This year, the event will be held at the Elements at Centris in Quezon City. (Landmark: Walking distance from Quezon Avenue MRT-3 Station).

keepsakes. checked in with the organizers Sei and Pao, and asked how are they preparing for the return of the event that brought the local anime idol fandom together.

## Preparations for AICon 2024

**Welcome back! How are the preparations for AICon 2024?**

**Sei:** It’s been a while since the last time we had AICON. We’re actually very excited about this comeback. These past few months are busy for us organizers since we've been juggling real life stuff with our hobby - events organizing.  
  
Since it’s a comeback, we actually blueprinted a lot of traditions from previous AICONs. Not only we retained most of the iconic parts but we added more twists!  
  
In order to live up to these expectations, there are new things that we implemented here that was already active from our previous events such as the Shikishi cards, more mini games within the event and so much more! We’re already on set. Please look forward to our comeback.

**Pao:** AICon is back, yay! All is going well indeed and that already makes us excited to take the stage once again. It's been years since the last AICon and we hope this will yet again be as memorable as it has always been for fellow anime idol fans. As we continue to move up, I hope everyone will keep their eyes peeled on what's in store for you.

## Upcoming Activities

**We notice there are more performers competing this time. What kind of performances should we look forward to?**

**Pao:** That’s right! There’s a variety of performances coming from different anime idol franchises. AICon aims to give everyone a dream-like concert experience and with this year’s line-up, having the classics and the latest dol series today, we are sure that this will be yet again another _AIConic_ one _(laughs)_  
  
Our performers are doing their best to prepare for and it would be great if everyone could pay close attention to what they will show us.

**Sei:** As posted in our social media channels, there’s a variety of contestants to join this time. We’re happy that a lot of performers want to join this festival. Our hearts flutter every time we were tagged in our performers’ practice posts. They really prepared well for this event so please look forward to their performance!

## What Makes AICon Special?

**What drives you to continue organizing AICon?**

**Pao:** before anything, most of the Producers behind Pygmalia are also idol fans. AICon was mainly created to celebrate this love with fellow anime idol fans and enthusiasts. Since our debut, we were touched to see how AICon was loved and anticipated by the anime idol community.  
  
We didn’t expect that this event would create an impact for them to remember as much. This drove us to bring back AICon again to show our appreciation not only to our beloved anime idols, but also for the community. _Gusto namin na nakikita kayo na masaya lagi :>_ (We want to see you happy always).

**Sei:** Passion and love for idols. As mentioned by Pao, AICON producers are firstly idol fans. We just want more people to join and celebrate with us. AICON 2019 was supposedly a one time event (we were graduating students back then).  
  
But when we saw how magical AICON became not only for us but also to those who attend, we decided to keep the passion and love ongoing. AICON is Pygmalia’s first child before there was even Pygmalia.

**Any message to our readers?**

**Sei:** Thank you so much for supporting AICON. Your support keeps us going. We’re happy to have you with us in our third installation and we hope to have your continued love. Keep the passion burning. See you in AICON!

**Pao:** Honestly, I already want to thank everyone who is looking forward to it. Anime Idol Convention wouldn’t be possible without your continued support.  
  
Now that the event’s nearing its most awaited comeback, watch out for what AICon has in stock for you from the performances down to the booths and other activities. I hope everyone will feel warmly welcomed to be themselves and say, _“I’m home~”._ Let’s all have fun together!
