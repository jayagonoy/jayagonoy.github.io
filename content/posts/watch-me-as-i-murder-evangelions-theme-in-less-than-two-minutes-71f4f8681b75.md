Part of the [**Animax Carnival Philippines 2016**](/animax-carnival-philippines-2016-aff968d2a10a) is the Karaoke Booth, which I tried on both days of the event singing “Fly Me to the Moon,” the 1954 Bart Howard-Kaye Ballard song that has been sang by Frank Sinatra a decade after.

This is the ending theme for Neon Genesis Evangelion, something that I have to watch in my spare time (read: I don’t), and possible the only anisong in English lyrics that I know (because it’s dangerous to me to sing in moonrunes — [I tried doing it miserably](/divisoria-timog-ave-22-october-2016-ba83bd0b9fdb)).
