Well, what do you know: At a Rotary event in Marikina, I saw two cosplayers as soon as I enter the venue. Turns out they were invited by a Rotary Club for an event this month.

Some of you knew that I’m now a member of the [Rotary Club of Mutya ng Pasig](http://fb.me/rotarymutyangpasig) (I got inducted at the end of September), and I was really thinking that I’m in a Oregairu situation (because anime is life). Maybe this could be the case for this picture, I may say.
