We have been covering events at [OtaCute](https://jayagonoy.com/keywords/otacute/) in Manila for so long, so we've seen how this small venue grew up to become a hotspot for anime culture. In this month's Otasuke Cosplay Festival, we have not just one but two venues which will cater to everything anime and cosplay.

Aside from the LA Village venue which saw a lot of performances, OtaCute is set to debut its Wallstreet venue, opening the door for a wider experience. This new venue, which has been teased for so long, sports a long catwalk with lots of screens, giving a better viewing experience.

With this in mind, let's get to know the highlights of this upcoming event.
