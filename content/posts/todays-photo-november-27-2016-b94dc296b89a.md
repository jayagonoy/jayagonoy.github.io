This is the only photo I got inside the ICITE Building at Eastwood City as **Toei Animation Philippines** celebrates its 30th year anniversary with a cosplay competition yesterday, November 26th.

Unlike the last one held five years ago — a full Cosplay float parade, grand activity at the Eastwood City’s Central Park — this one was so simple.

This is part of the celebration of Animahenasyon10 — the Philippine Animation Festival — held annually by the Animation Council of the Philippines (in which the company I’m with is part of this year’s team).
