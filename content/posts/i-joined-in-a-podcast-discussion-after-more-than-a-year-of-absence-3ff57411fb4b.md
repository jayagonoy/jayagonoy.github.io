**It’s been a long time since I joined a podcast — the last one was around September 2015**

Hi everyone!,

Just right after 2017 kicks in, **The Reimaru Files** has finished uploading their Year-Ender Events Review, of which I am a guest analyst. 

We talked about local events in the country — I’d like to give you a heads-up that in the first part, I was pretty much murky and not in my proper consciousness discussing about TOYCON (of which I am part of its staff), but nevertheless I shifted to what I’d like to talk about the best — Anime-related events.

[**The episode is on YouTube now**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uN7AjJ-vOk0), and it lasts for an hour. I recommend you to have a great time-based internet connection to listen to this; nevertheless, you can try saving the whole episode through the YouTube app for listening later on.

Prior to this, I also guested in the third episode of the **Anime Pilipinas** Podcast “**APN Conversations**” with [JM](https://medium.com/u/66b854fa2a40) and [Red](https://medium.com/u/31555fc8f4b); and we talked about industry-related stuff such as the Asian Television Awards (where _Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress_ is nominated for this year’s 2D Animation category), the Oscars™ (where _your name._ is being considered to be in the list of nominations for the Best Animated Film category), our take on Coldplay’s Manila ticket prices and the never-ending conundrum that is TV5 and what it could have done from our points of view.

_I’m still waiting for a confirmation if this will be released as there were major updates on some of the news that we were talking about; hopefully that gets settled._

More than a year has already passed, I’m still rusty on podcasting (though coping up and trying to get my stand clearly), and I came in these shows unprepared; but these went well in the end, setting aside the times I “overstepped my professional capacity as a part of the events industry” for a persona that I used to be way way back before.

I look forward to be future podcasts, much witty and saner than these; but for now, listen to our ramblings in an effort to shed light on things.

_In case you want to her my past podcasts during my time at Deremoe,_ [_here’s a quick recap of the best episodes we have_](/the-best-podcasts-deremoe-have-b05649cfba54)_._

**Happy New Year, everyone! Enjoy the rest of the Sunday.**
