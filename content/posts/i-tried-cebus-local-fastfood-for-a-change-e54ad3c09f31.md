Cebu has its share of local restaurants — some of them include **Orange Brutus** and **Jonie’s**. Here’s my first impressions of the meals I ate:

## Orange Brutus

SM Cebu has just opened its doors this morning. I was asked by my workmate where we can eat for breakfast, to which I said that we won’t go to Jollibee because I have eaten their meals for days. Then I stumbled upon Orange Brutus.

Describing itself as “Cebu’s first favorite,” Orange Brutus was established on the 80’s, long before Jollibee and McDonald’s appeared in the city. I tried their breakfast tocino meal, and the meat is great as it is convenient to slice to bite-sized pieces.

## Jonie’s

After doing what happens to be my first social media campfire session (_I’m doing it for free once again tomorrow, so visit the Cebu Trade Hall so we can talk about stuff_), I am treated to a takeaway of Jonie’s, which is my kind of a fastfood full course — steak, egg, sausage and rice with corn on the side. The sauce is just delicious, though I do have reservations in the meat.

**Tomorrow’s my last day at the Cebu Trade Hall, and afterwards I’ll be spending my last hours in Cebu travelling to places — yes, I will make sure that my camera is ready to take beautiful photos.**
