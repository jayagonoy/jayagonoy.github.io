_Otaku Expo Tanabata Festival is back, covering all of Megatrade Hall this weekend!_

Most people know Tanabata as a star festival held on July 7, but a conversation with [Allineus](https://www.facebook.com/aprodv2/) had me Google the keyword "Tanabata season." After a few clicks, I saw this post from [Japan Guide](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2283.html) which reads:

> Because the 7th month of the year roughly coincides with August rather than July according to the formerly used lunar calendar, Tanabata is still celebrated on August 7 in some regions of Japan, while it is celebrated on July 7 in other regions.

The organizer of Ozine Fest and Otaku Expo had its Tanabata Festival Special event at Ayala Malls Manila Bay on the weekend of July 15-16 ([I was able to capture snapshots there](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.741446947990621&type=3)). To follow that is the main Otaku Expo Tanabata Festival to be held this weekend at Megatrade Halls 1 to 3 of SM Megamall in Mandaluyong City.

Knowing that Otaku Expo has been a name in Manila's convention circuit since its first edition in 2010, I'm pretty sure that it's been a constant staple of the cosplay crowd as time passed by:

- Currently, [Otaku Expo](https://jayagonoy.com/photos-from-otaku-expo-2017-eaa70e3faafe/) has two editions—an [Anime and Manga Drawing Special](https://jayagonoy.com/otaku-expo-presents-anime-and-manga-drawing-special-on-january-25-26-2020/) held at the start of the year, and the Tanabata Festival which we are to talk about. Preceding the Tanabata Festival concept was [Otaku Expo Reload](https://jayagonoy.com/watch-and-read-my-otaku-expo-reload-2017-experience-87a2068eb8b2/) which ran for some time.

- In 2020 we are fortunate to ask [DMYO / Nao Shirahane](https://jayagonoy.com/otaku-expo-2020-interview-with-nao-shirahane-dmyo/) a few questions. I know DMYO best for her illustration of Culture Japan (Danny Choo)'s Mirai Suenaga.

- I interviewed [Hanari from Hong Kong](https://vtubernewsdrop.com/interview-hanari-hong-kong-cosplayer-recognized-by-haachama/), a cosplayer recognized by hololive Production's Akai Haato, for VTuber NewsDrop. That interview happened at Otaku Expo Tanabata last year.

- Otaku Expo has invited cosplayers from nearby countries, such as [Miu and Shimo](https://jayagonoy.com/thoughts-on-otaku-expo-2018-ae069b465e1e/) (in 2018), as well as [Luffy and Tsubasa](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=932414150140653&set=a.731649158319947) in 2016. At the Tanabata Special last July, I met [Misaki from Thailand](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=741446524657330&set=a.741446947990621).

**Otaku Expo** already has a detailed guide on Facebook, but to make it brief and concise, the venue is going to make good use of its three halls for all visitors:

**Hall 1**—Most of the time, we'll be here to capture photos of cosplayers in their best poses. We may also have our interviews done in this area. _(keepsakes. is a media partner for the event.)_

- **Photoshoot Area** (Organizer's note: _"We will be dividing the space to accommodate more photographers. Just a reminder to the photographers to discuss amongst yourselves so that we can give a chance to other photographers as well."_)
- **Tanabata Area** featuring the games you'd usually see in an outdoor fest in Japan. Note that if you are dressed up in a kimono, you can get treats like free popcorn and cotton candy. You can also rent kimonos in the area, or browse through these kimonos on display.
- **Cosplayer Guests Meet and Greet Area**
- **Baggage Area** (Charges may apply)
- **Busking Area** (featuring surprise performers singing to the tune of your favorite anime songs)
- **Food Stalls and Refreshments**

**Hall 2**—The largest hall at Megatrade in terms of space will host a lot of exhibitors as well as the stage area.

- **Stage Area**—We'll be here for the Battle of the Bands, Singing Competitions, Cosplay Competition and the like.
- **Sponsors** such as Japan Foundation Manila, Ragnarok Origin Online, Razer Gold, Mineski Slash, and Fuwa Fuwa are here.
- **Ragnarok Origin Online Cafe**—I remember that one time I went to what was supposed to be the [last Ozine Maid Cafe](https://jayagonoy.com/ozine-maid-cafe-2018-5da5510c5acc/), only to see that they've revived this again and this time teamed up with Ragnarok Origin and Razer Gold.

**Hall 3**—This is where you go for merchandise and fan arts.

There will also be areas at Halls 1 and 2 allocated for people with disabilities and senior citizens called **Ozine Cares**:

- Hall 1—near the busking area
- Hall 2—near the side of the stage

**Sskait**, a comic creator of today's generation and now a staple in most conventions, will be releasing a limited edition "Shiny Sakura Talong" plush at Otaku Expo Tanabata Festival.
