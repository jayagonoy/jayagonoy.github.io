Every year there's always a case of a [streamer](https://x.com/gutsluvr/status/1580738198254153728) (or in this case, a [VTuber](https://x.com/HadesMythos/status/1837423768089874588)) getting drugged/spiked at parties around TwitchCons in the US (this you can fact-check in depth), and it's quite concerning that victim-blaming and harassment happens afterwards. No, rephrase that, it's **deplorable** that those who got drugged get torched by some guys online after saying they were drugged.

I have been fortunate enough to not see any of this in the bar events I attended here in Manila so far. The one time I see something crazy at the bar in person was the time where one would barf up after getting intoxicated with alcohol.

Going back to the issue at hand, I read this thread and quickly picked up on a few details.

{{<twitter user="emuuki_" id="1838394316789617101" >}}

1. Security was present but it's not adequately doing its role to help the bar-goers

3. Drink covers were there but not handed out

5. It was a VIP party

Of course the comments in this thread ask Blerp to take responsibility (it's too late), that Blerp extends help (it's too late), and as Blerp confirms, it was the second incident to happen at that party (why).

If by any chance of a silver lining I get invited to a bar party of that kind I, am only sure to get Ginger Ale and ask for a cover. I swore off not to drink any alcohol either, give me soft drinks or water.

However, it is not my responsibility to be paranoid and think all drinks are spiked. I've been in the events industry for years and I can spot some faults which are actionable in the future:

1. Get a Security provider who doesn't just put bouncers in the area, **go ask for a proper risk assessment too** (additional charges may apply)

3. Have the security join you in the **ocular inspection**, which can be done days before the party happens so everyone is made aware of the scenarios which could happen and take action accordingly

5. **Make it mandatory to cover all drinks** (proactive approach), let the baristas have all the drink covers they can use as they prepare the drinks on the spot in front of the partygoers

I cannot just assume and just say that the bar and the host did not made any mandatory safety checks hours before and during the party. That's carelessness if it's proven true.

There's a lot of resources online that tells bar owners, hosts, bar-hoppers etc. what they can do in order to make a party a safe space. Knowing what the [angel shot](https://www.spoton.com/blog/what-is-an-angel-shot-how-bars-can-keep-patrons-safe/) is, the emergency numbers saved in the restrooms, briefing the security personnel and reminding them before each party of the rules and proper decorum, etc.

What else can we do to prevent another case of spiking, a checklist? Do we need to be paranoid and assume that all drinks are spiked? No, I do not need to be paranoid, we got to do something. Anything.
