Alrighty guys, **I’m set to stay in Cebu by the first weekend of December** to hold an event at SM City Cebu’s **Cebu Trade Hall**. This will be my first time there, and here’s what I’m planning to do:

1. Take a set of photos so I can share them with you here
2. Taste the food
3. Look at the TV channels available

If time permits, I can do a daily photo log of what I did during my stay there. That’s it for me now, and I hope to see you there. **Cebu, I’m coming!**
