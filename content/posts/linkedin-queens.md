Queens. A Logic Game that's on LinkedIn. I get notified to play this game every day to keep my streak. I gave up on playing one game, but I went ahead and got my first 7-day win streak after.

On this puzzle, a crown should be placed without overlaps. Per area, per row, per column. If this is the reason why you're visiting LinkedIn every day, I will not judge you. More power to you. I hope you solve that puzzle faster, even.
