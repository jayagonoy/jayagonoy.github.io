Today, I am at iBlog 11, and I’m going to leave a message before I proceed to listening and learning the talks:

> I am sorry that I cannot keep my words — to quit writing about the community of anime and cosplay fans — which I miserably failed to commit.

By getting back to iBlog, I am getting back to **square one**. Regrets aside, I am here, alive, and still writing to everyone who reads this.

I will do my best to be calm in this occasion, but if you noticed me, a ‘hi’ will suffice.

On another note, I’m happy that Medium’s Android app is cpmpatible with my phone. Look forward to my short updates on #iBlog11.
