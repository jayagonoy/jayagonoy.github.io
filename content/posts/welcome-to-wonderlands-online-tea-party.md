I have been invited to attend **Welcome to Wonderland**'s online tea party last Sunday, August 28, 2022. This is the prelude to the much-awaited event for Lolita, Harajuku and J- Fashion enthusiasts happening around two weeks after. This 4-hour online event was attended by around 50 guests and visitors.

Featured guests in the online party include Japanese Shironui artist [Minori](https://www.minori.co/), Japanese artist and lolita fashion enthusiast [Midori Yusa](http://midoriyusa.com/), stage, screen, and voice artist [Maronne Cruz](https://www.facebook.com/maronnecosplay), fashion blogger [Sanakan](https://sanakanin.wordpress.com/?), kimono stylist [Krystof](https://www.facebook.com/KimonoByKrystof/), and the [Yu-En Cosplay](https://www.facebook.com/yuencosplayofficial) tandem of Den and Ayu. The finalists for the Fashion and Art competitions were also announced at this event.

Interesting discussions on Lolita and J-Fashion culture, such as how did the guests got introduced to it, what's their latest look, and how are they continuing the J-Fashion vibe until now.
