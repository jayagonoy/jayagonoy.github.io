Last year, pumunta ako sa Philippine Game Dev Expo, at masaya naman ako sa results: I was able to test yung mga Indie Games being showcased there, tapos nag-cover rin ako for NewsDrop: Duon ko unang nakita si Ran-kun ng Rumble Royale after all.

Organized by CBZN Perspective and Game Development Association of the Philippines or GDAP, the Expo is a groundbreaking event that unites the gaming industry and showcase the wealth of talent within the Filipino gaming community.

Mga humigit kumulang 18,000 lang naman ang naglabas-pasok sa PGDX last year, on top of 54 confirmed meetings in its business-to-business (B2B) platform.

## What's Inside PGDX 2024?

For first-timers, ang PGDX na sinet-up last year ay nagso-showcase ng mga latest sa game dev scene. Recommended na puntahan ito ng mga nag-aaral na gumawa ng games - local or international, mapa-mobile o desktop.

Maraming ideya at proof of work ang pinapakita dito, so baka makakuha ka ng inspirasyon sa PGDX.

- **Workshops & Panels:** Learn from top industry experts.

- **Expo Floor:** Explore the latest games and technologies - eto talaga ginawa ko last year, umikot sa hall, mag-picture tas mag-test ng mga laro kahit saglit lang.
    - **Indie Game Stars:** Get a look at the work of our talented local and international indie game developers.

- **Networking Opportunities:** Connect with professionals and peers - alam ko, may sariling B2B platform ang PGDX where you can exchange virtual contacts and set up meetings.
