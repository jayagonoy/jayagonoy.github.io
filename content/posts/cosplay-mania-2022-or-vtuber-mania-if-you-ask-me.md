I'm not yet tired. I'm brimming with passion, passion that was fueled by me going to Cosplay Mania 2022 last weekend. I spent the whole weekend being blessed with a lot of cosplay photos, and I have a rough estimate that 90% of it are VTuber cosplays, because yes, I'm covering the event for [NewsDrop](https://www.vtubernewsdrop.com), and I'm looking forward to sharing relevant stuff there soon.

Also, the event was [covered in The Philippine STAR](https://www.philstar.com/other-sections/star-cover/2022/10/02/2213659/star-cover-september-2-2022) front page. By now I think I'm not the only one who has noticed this.

For now, let me say that it's Monday, _I love my job_, and I have to finish backlogs. What I'm going to share today are selfies from this event, followed by quick captions.

You got to see how me and my friends coerced Madekuji into having a [photo-op with her together](https://twitter.com/Madekuji_san/status/1576411294168584192), it was hilarious."

Tsukimi Lune is Anime Corner's mascot and VTuber talent, and after my departure at AC, she is now under the care of Project Solaria. Veru, on the other hand, was an independent VTuber who's behind the @[PHVTuberLive](https://twitter.com/PHVTuberLive) bot. She became [part of Solaria](https://twitter.com/Project_Solaria/status/1575696944869134337) just before September ended.
