The **Jollibee Halo-Halo Sundae** is part of the fastfood chain’s limited edition Filipino selections launched as part of the Philippine Independence Day celebration this June. (The other one is the Adobo Flakes Yum! Burger, which has lower reception compared to this dessert, I think.)

It’s the usual Jollibee Sundae topped with Halo-Halo toppings. After eating one last Tuesday, I ate one more the following day, and one more last Thursday.

For Php35, I was hooked to it. It doesn’t have _leche flan_ on top of it, but it’s still delicious. Maybe it was the taste of the vanilla iced cream mixed with the flavors of the toppings, or it may be because of something else.
