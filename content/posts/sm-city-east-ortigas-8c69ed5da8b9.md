Today’s video is taken from the newly-opened SM City East Ortigas SM Supermalls’ 60th mall. Formerly the Ever Gotesco Ortigas Complex, SM got the property after it was listed as one of Ever’s assets that are disposed (more of this on a 2014 Manila Standard story about tycoon Lucio Tan expanding the University of the East, which is somehow related).


“This latest destination adds more than 80,000 square meters (sqm) in gross floor area (GFA) and is suited to offer a fresher and more colorful vibe in the eastern part of Metro Manila,” according to [an SM Prime press release](https://web.archive.org/web/20170704105701/http://www.smprime.com:80/sm-prime-opens-sm-city-east-ortigas). [The mall opened last December 2](http://news.abs-cbn.com/business/12/02/16/sm-opens-east-ortigas-mall-companys-60th), and I looked on to Facebook to give me updates [while I was in Cebu](/what-my-5d-6n-trip-to-cebu-meant-to-me-af63833a1d92).

This video won’t be unique with a trippy vaporwave sound in it, so I slammed in a [_s a r s i クネタ_ track](https://sarsi-cuneta.bandcamp.com/) (_I love you sarsi_).
