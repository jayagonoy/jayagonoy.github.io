Gravity Game Hub announced that **Ragnarok Origin** reached 10 million pre-registrations Wednesday April 5. Special rewards are unlocked for all players.

- **Ragnarok Origin** retains the lore while stepping forward in reinventing traditional massive multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs). This means that battles can now be affected by weather conditions, and outcome of quests may be influenced by plot choices.

- In addition to the recreation of the Midgard continent, _Ragnarok Origin_ offers six diverse major classes. Graphics, combat, and social features are upgraded.

- Midgard offers unique enemies and instances which can be encountered both day and night. The much-loved guild system is still intact, giving parties the opportunity to beat challenging bosses.

- Southeast Asia will first experience the new _Ragnarok_ gameâ€”in person! See the cute and lovable characters BTS and CentralWorld in Thailand, SM Mall of Asia in The Philippines, IMBI Plaza in Malaysia, and Mall Taman Anggrek in Indonesia.

- From April 6 to April 19, players can share their experiences with the game at the comments section of its new _Ragnarok Origin_ Facebook page, and they can get the chance to win HyperX gaming keyboards and mouses, iQIYI monthly VIP and other prizes.
