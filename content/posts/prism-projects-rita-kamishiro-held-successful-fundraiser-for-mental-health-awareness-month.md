Rita Kamishiro of PRISM Project has successfully raised US$10,000 during her charity stream last May 15 for the United States-based [National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)](https://www.nami.org/). The charity stream held in support of Mental Health Awareness Month brings together other virtual personalities such as [Ying](https://twitter.com/ying_verse), [Meru Matsuro](https://twitter.com/matsuromeru), and Phase Connect’s [Pipkin Pippa](https://twitter.com/pipkinpippa) to discuss their personal experiences and the tips they had learned on their own mental health journey.

During the charity stream, all of the donation goals have been unlocked by the community. The accomplished goals lead to the next set of events for the PRISM agent, such as “trying to run a 5K while eating ghost peppers,” playing Minesweeper in VR, and doing a themed “anime character workout.”

Mental health is a topic Rita is passionate about, and she is happier to be able to bring awareness about it through her platform. Following the stream, she thanked her fans for raising so much for a good cause.

NAMI is the largest grassroots mental health organization in the US dedicated to helping people affected by mental illness. As NAMI amplifies its message, “Together for Mental Health,” it continues to help build better lives through advocacy, education, support and public awareness.

Youth.gov notes that the National Mental Health Month was established in 1949 to increase awareness of the importance of mental health and wellness in Americans’ lives, as well as to celebrate recovery from mental illness.

As a PRISM agent, Rita Kamishiro plays a variety of games and hosts her RKNGL radio show on stream. Rita actively shares her journey to become an idol on a weekly basis to her 24,000-strong YouTube subscriber-base.
