After participating in AniZone’s first series viewing in Marikina [featuring Halo Halo House](https://web.facebook.com/halohalohouse/photos/a.498110863702006.1073741826.498097463703346/521181121394980/?type=3), I got the chance to visit a restaurant that is closer to what Japan offers — Tamagoya Noodle House.

At around ₱180, you can enjoy a big bowl of ramen that should serve as your dinner for the night. The metro and nearby provinces felt a few light rain showers, so it was the perfect time to keep myself well.

_Tamagoya is located at 2 Hon. B. Soliven Avenue, Antipolo City. From the Masinag Public Market, you ride a jeep going to Marikina and drop off at B. Soliven Avenue. From there, you can walk to Tamagoya._
