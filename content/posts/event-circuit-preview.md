With anime/cosplay events in the metro running almost every weekend, we figured that it's the right time to give the newcomers a preview of what's coming up next, so **[The Reimaru Files](https://reimarufiles.com)** and **_keepsakes._** spearhead what will be known as the **Events Circuit Preview** series.

Our first episode covers the next two weeks of the month, including the big weekend of May 19-22 where each part of the metro will have their share of events, starting with three major events at SMX Manila (for the southies)â€”Mini Ozine Fest, Unbox Con and the Manila Game Fest, FanFes @ Circuit Makati (for those in the middle) and the Pinoy Otaku Festival in Novaliches (for the northies).
