Aside from having a short chat with Belldandy, I was able to talk with a name in the Anime localization industry — Hero TV’s Dubbing Director Pinky Rebucas. Pinky has been in the voice acting industry since 1998, and her voice has been in a lot of series. I was supposed to ask this while they were on stage but unfortunately due to time constraints they had to cut the interaction segment out of the segment.

Here’s a transliterated transcript of the short chat I had with her.

**Jay**: What made you a dubbing director?  

**Pinky Rebucas**: At first, of course, experience. Way, way back 1998, I dub in any series, Korean series, cartoons, even until Anime came; so, experience.

I also do the script and handle the voice actors especially if we are only with ourselves inside the booth. It is experience that shaped me to be a dubbing director.

**Jay**: What was your most memorable experience when it comes to Anime?  

**PR**: Actually, the scenes. Knowing Anime, you feel clueless when there are a lot of scenes, so it’s shocking because at times you will ask “wait a moment,” and something like that, so that’s a bit challenging and something I can’t forget since I’m doing cartoons, Korean series, etc… and the character designs are cute; and the story itself — there’s something different in the stories of Anime series.

**Jay**: What is the most memorable scenes in an Anime series that you directed in your stint as a dubbing director so far?  

**PR**: When I’m doing \[the Hero TV broadcast of\] _Code Geass_.

It feels memorable since the source material has a different catch — it surprised me on what power Lelouch Lamperouge has compared to the cute-type or love stories that I’ve handled. Also, _Kyou Kara Maou_. It has a bit of a man-to-man relationship that appears in the series.

**Jay**: Let’s move on to the challenges that you face as a dubbing director for Anime series. What was so far the biggest criticism that you have ever received?  

**PR**: To be honest, none so far.  

**Jay**: Thank goodness, thank goodness.  

**PR**: Yes, none so far, so I’m happy that fans love the Anime series itself and they liked how we localized it to Filipino, and I’m so happy for that.

**Jay**: Moving back to Code Geass, would that be also the most difficult or challenging role that you did?  

**PR**: Ah, there are different levels of difficulty so I can’t answer if that was the most difficult or what, but casting, yes. Code Geass has lots of characters, and there are times that all of them speak simultaneously.

Compared to \[my direction of\] _My Bride is a Mermaid_ that everyone speaks but it’s for fun; the story is fun, Code Geass is serious, so we have a marker full of the lines, the terms used; so thinking \[of a way to deliver it\] is necessary.

\\I have a Japanese translator with me to explain that this is it, this is what that character is supposed to say, and that should sync in \[with the animation\], and I have to come up with a good argument \[dialogue\] for that.

**Jay**: So far, what’s the latest series that you have? 
 
**PR**: Right now, I’m doing Kyou Kara Maou Season 3, and please do wait for \[a localized\] Code Geass movie \[OVA to be aired soon\].  

**Jay**: In your voice acting side, do you have any roles that you are doing right now?  

**PR**: Yes, I have. i also dub for Kyou Kara Maou as Ulric, and I just finished dubbing a lot of characters… \[\*checks list\*\] so I have Misaka from _To Aru Kagaku no Railgun_ —  

**Jay**: Misaka Mikoto, yes, good, …  

**PR**: Then on Code Geass, I dubbed Nunnally and Cornelia, which will be on the OVA, \[…\] and also, Date A Live’s Yoshino.  

**Jay**: Yoshino, not Yoshinon.  

**PR**: Yes \[Yoshino\]; no, no \[not Yoshinon\].
