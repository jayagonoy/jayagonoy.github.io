I did a series of interviews at TOYCON 2024 (with special thanks to Ambox Events) featuring guests from Japan and the local idol scene. First on the video above is **Ai Negishi**, who may be familiar with most idol fans twice my age as the leader of girl group Passpo. (I was more familiar with her as part of D4DJ's Merm4id member Dalia Matsuyama).

Next video released is **Day Night Explorers** led by Ashley Cloud. Joining her is Kiku (Yana) and Sara who may be more familiar to others as members of a legendary local idol unit.

Third on the line is Ambox's homegrown idol group **Pastel Mix**, who is represented at TOYCON 2024 by Thea, Kanon and Cherry, all surnamed Pyon.

Other Japanese guests we've interviewed were **BUGVEL**, **Chicken Blow the Idol**, **Tenohira El** and **Sakura Doll**. Other groups ZIGA and KUROGURO also performed, but they were performing during the time of our recording.

(I am told KUROGURO disbanded a few days ago, which made me reminisce of the time I interviewed them at ARCHCon Cebu 2023.)

I have released the videos regardless if they were properly subtitled or not, following the conclusion of activities under the _keepsakes._ brand first mentioned [last September](/desk-diary-september-10-2024/), as I focus my attention towards sustaining my other venture, VTuber NewsDrop, as its editor.

I thank Ambox National for their trust -- and I'll continue to support their activities, including their upcoming partnership with Geek+Pop Alpha coming this March 2025 at the World Trade Center.
