For the past few years, this website (as well as its social media handles) has been a witness to various events in the Philippines' pop culture circuit. Most of you have seen me advocate for several events like the World Cosplay Summit or the local idol culture.

I have now reached a point where my energy and resources can no longer compensate for going to several places in a single day. I've spent my life in the events industry so much that I built and broke bridges.

My birthday is almost approaching, and I figured to myself what's my purpose now that I have practically left the events industry, the same field I wish I could have served (and sometimes fought for) longer than just 7 or 8 years being employed.

To be clear with you, I have been gathering myself as I live my life outside Manila, outside the dreaded traffic, and the stresses of not being able to enjoy the life I used to do so for as long as I have been employed.

I am no longer enjoying sharing about my thoughts on the internet, the same way I used to a decade ago. I stopped blogging, I started tweeting (and retweeting) too much, I hurriedly distance myself from anyone with a bad reputation, I was not enjoying my life and my satisfaction felt nowhere.

I'm not sure what to do with **keepsakes.** nowadays because you'll either see me do stuff for [VTuber NewsDrop](https://vtubernewsdrop.com) or just upload photos on a Facebook album.

I talked to myself if I should really let go of the things I used to love, but in order for change to happen, I should be more firm with my resolve. I'll still be here or on NewsDrop, but for real, I am setting up to retire the **keepsakes.** brand in the future.

That said, here's an announcement:
<p>
<div style="color: black; background: white; padding: 2em">

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold">ANNOUNCEMENT</p>

Thank you for your continued trust and support of **keepsakes.**  
  
Preparations are being put in place to reorganize **keepsakes.**, including but not limited to:

1. **Suspension of video production.** There are several videos lined up to be posted early this year but are already overdue, due to internal factors. Once these videos are posted, video production will be suspended indefinitely.

3. **Reorganization of social media assets.** All social media assets under the name of **keepsakes.** will be rebranded under the name "Jay Agonoy" effective this week. **keepsakes.**' Facebook page has became a repository of photos from past events, and will remain as such.

5. **Sunsetting of the _jayagonoy.xyz_ domain.** After 8 fruitful years, the domain jayagonoy.xyz will no longer be renewed after October 28, 2024. Efforts were done to redirect the website to its current domain, jayagonoy.com.

All inquiries regarding this announcement should be directed to the email address hello \[at\] jayagonoy \[dot\] com.  
  
We thank you for your kind support and understanding of our future endeavors.

I did expect to write a black-text-on-a-white-background letter, but I don't want to be so dramatic to cut off everything out of sight. What an announcement, however. If you find this update confusing, don't worry, I'm not ok and I hope to be ok soon.
