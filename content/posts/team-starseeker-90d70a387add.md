Sending this [video here](https://www.facebook.com/epski07/videos/10206172415421014/) for everyone to see — this is a video from Davao, where Team Starseeker won the WCSPH National Finals for 2016 and will represent the country in the World Cosplay Summit in Nagoya, Japan.

I’ve taken a look at the Facebook profiles of the team, and based on their info, both of them are craftsmakers, who own their own respective cosplay craft shops. 

One of them, **Yukari** (who also posts under the name “Endlesseight Cosplay”), also served as co-host of the 7th Mindanao Toy Convention of Gaisano Mall Davao (not associated with [ToyCon PH](/toycon-2016-pop-life-fanxperience-june-2016-be54172f110f)).

I’m confident to say that Yukari is the more vocal person in the team. You can see her profile below:

The other half of the team, **Gomz**, was part of a band called “Insert Coin,” which is active around 2013.
