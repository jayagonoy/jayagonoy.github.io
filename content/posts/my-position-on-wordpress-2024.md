**Welcome to the airport**, where we have departures upstairs and arrivals at the ground level. I had everyone called here (not really) so you won't give any excuses that there's no need to announce something (I just don't want to hear it at the moment).

When I had talked about wanting to go to WordCamp Manila as media, I was both excited to attend a major WordPress event, and still leaning to keep supporting Matt Mullenweg's vision of WordPress for the future.

I then continue to move along, but at the end of the day, we see how either everyone tells me that Matt is a Mad King or either Matt tells everyone that he's enlightened.

The year 2024 is a revelation for me to keep a distance towards what I perceive as bad actors (my gut feel tells me so), and unfortunately after all that's been said and done, WP Engine wins against Mullenweg, the latter was still seen making hissy fits, and the future of the WordPress ecosystem is becoming stubbornly questionable to me (what words should I describe the feelings I have?).

Don't get me wrong, WP Engine is under [the behest of an investment fund](https://wpengine.com/blog/milestone-announcement/) and [does not contribute fairly to WordPress](https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/22/matt-mullenweg-calls-wp-engine-a-cancer-to-wordpress-and-urges-community-to-switch-providers/) (drawing Mullenweg's ire) is also a jerk. If only they did what they were supposed to do in the first place, we won't have this kind of unwarranted, unwanted anxiety and vitriol.

I get the sentiments, but my opinion is that WP Engine should get rid of its "WP" part of their name, and Mullenweg should tone down on his control of WordPress as time passes. Automattic? WordPress Foundation? WordPress.org? WordPress.com? We all attribute it to the same guy, Mullenweg.

I want to move to Ghost, as soon as possible. I'm happy to use it despite the technical requirements in order to run it. Except that the webhost where this site is hosted has something in it that keeps me from fully going Ghost. I'm currently in touch with my good friend Pat on how to sort the dilemma so I can start migrating platforms (once again).

**So yeah, the announcement:** I'm going to move my website from WordPress.org to somewhere else. That somewhere else is currently a fork of WordPress, [ClassicPress](https://www.classicpress.net/). It's a bumpy start, the media picker doesn't work well as we speak, but as long as this website's out of the WordPress ecosystem, I think I should be fine. (I need to find an easier way to back up all my blog archives from as early as 2010 though.)

I've used WordPress after ditching Blogger (spammy) and Tumblr (they continuously fail to give me back my access after my phone got snatched), but just when I thought I'd be comfortable with the way things are going, no, I am not.

I'll need more time, but I expect to at least migrate my personal stuff away from the WordPress ecosystem next year (and if you're using WordPress, as long as you're not using WP Engine, you probably should be fine either).
