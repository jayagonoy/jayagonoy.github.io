Let me just pull up a quickie here and let everyone know that the **2016 National Finals of the** **World Cosplay Summit Philippines (WCSPH)** will be held on **July 2 (Saturday)** as part of the Japan Cultural Festival at **SM City Davao**.

There are eight (8) teams selected from different places, as follows:

- Team JBF (NCR),
- Team COSAGA (NCR),
- Team Albay Otaku (Southern Luzon),
- Team ACE (Visayas),
- Team Usaka Sumbag Bai (Visayas),
- Team Sakura Punch (Mindanao),
- Team Starseeker (Mindanao) and
- Team Weapon & Mask Destruction (Mindanao)

My predictions are going to any of the teams that are part of the Mindanao Conference, but I am rooting for Team COSAGA.

If you support WCSPH, or the teams that will participate; or just want to go to Davao, take photos as souvenirs when you come back home to Manila.

I’m taking my time here, and if it happens that the Finals gets held in Mindanao for the second time, I’ll be going there.

This is the fourth time we’ll be picking our representatives, and as an observer of WCS in the country, I am excited to see the developments. No one’s hyping about this yet, so let me do my best to ring the bell and get everyone ready. I’m going to do my best to be here at the sidelines.
