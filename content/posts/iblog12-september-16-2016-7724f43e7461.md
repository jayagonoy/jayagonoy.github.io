Five years ago, I went to my first iBlog (the 7th Philippine Blogging Summit) at the Malcolm Theater of UP Diliman College of Law. A year after, I went on to speak in the perspective of a content creator, emphasizing the uniqueness of one’s content.

Three years — and lots of t-shirts — later, [I’m still here](http://iblogph.org/2016/08/09/get-ready-see-you-at-iblog12-on-september-16). I’ve officially made this a tradition of mine.

Unlike the rest of the iBlogs I’ve attended, this year’s program topics are not community-sourced, and it’s only held for one day. This is a good thing, as it does itself a fresh start anew.

On a sidenote, one thing I regret in attending this year’s Summit is to bring my laptop to jot down notes— turns out that I don’t need to bring it, and it also distracts me from focusing on the topic. Lesson learned.

The tradition will live on and I will see everyone in the next year’s summit. Thanks [Janette Toral](https://medium.com/u/fed9268a7a01) and Atty. JJ Disini for this year’s iBlog!
