Pioneer Films (under the name Viewers Choice Philippines) released an update about the screening date of Makoto Shinkai’s “your name.,” which was set to be screened in cinemas December 14:

> Due to pending issues with the Metro Manila Film Festival that affected movie booking schedules, the December 14 release date of the movie YOUR NAME (Kimi no Na wa) is still pending. Keep on calling your favorite cinemas to convince them to book the movie the soonest! We will keep you posted for any developments. Thank you for your understanding.

I implore everyone who can see this message to visit your nearby movie theater (whether if it’s Ayala, SM, Sta. Lucia and the like) and persuade them to book the movie. For good measure, go make events on Facebook to gather all fans and cosplayers to watch the movie all together.
