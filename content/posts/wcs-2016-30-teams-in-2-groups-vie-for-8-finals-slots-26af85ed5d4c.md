_Just a quick update_ on **World Cosplay Summit 2016** — last year, the Championships was held on just one Saturday, but now, things have changed.

Take a look at this photo shared by the World Cosplay Summit Philippines (WCSPH) on Facebook (above) — there are two groups, Group A and Group B. The Philippines is in Group B, #25 on the sequence. Each group has 15 country-teams.

It is stated that **only eight (8) teams will be selected from each group** to compete in the championship the next day (Sunday, August 7th). To think that they won’t go run for two whole days, I have to adjust my schedule.

What I am anxious about is the fact that the Philippines will go on against **14 other teams** in the group they’re with. I’m pretty sure that this will be much, much tougher for our [Team StarSeeker](/team-starseeker-90d70a387add) — and **they need more of our support to help them push their limits**.

Now let me place here the promo image I did just now as a show of support for our Team Philippines this year, which is similar to [the ones I did for Team NCR during the National Finals](/ncr-teams-lets-get-it-on-3b31304a45dd).
