I really waited for this day — and lack of sleep is no match for my renewed enthusiasm to come to one of my favorite refresher conferences.

**The 2nd DLSU Communication Conference** has expanded further, featuring more new and recent trends in quad media. I’ll be sharing a few tidbits from the sessions that I listened to during this whole-day activity.

In the morning plenary session, media pros such as Rappler’s **Maria Ressa**, indie filmmaker **Ellen Ongkeko-Marfil**, the Philippine Daily Inquirer’s **John Nery**, **David Guerrero** of BBDO Guerrero and ABS-CBN’s **JR dela Cerna**. 

Nery, whom I’ve been introduced first in the GMA Network broadcast of the PiliPinas Debates, did an experiment on Twitter prior to his talk, in which I got curious.

Of all the hands-on breakout sessions that are in the program (I really tell you, they are a lot), I chose to check out how to make a 360-degree photo using a “rotator” and photo-stitching software.

This writer with photographer and journalist [Fung Yu](https://www.instagram.com/fung360/), who showed us how to use a rotator and produce a 360-degree photo.

I was able to meet journalist and photographer **Fung Yu**. He has covered a lot of news events, and also produces 360 images for his project “[Philippine Heritage in 360.](http://pamana.ph/)”

Before this, I was reintroduced to social media and content marketing by [Ros Juan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosariojuan) of Commune Bar and Resto and Godfrey Santos from the Inquirer, respectively.

The final parts of the program featuring a panel discussion with media professionals.

Spending the Saturday at La Salle — after being at the 47th National Marketing Conference as part of work — was worth it. No words can express my utmost appreciation for the organizers, and I will definitely back for a third run.

Capping off the post are photos taken outdoors. See you soon!
