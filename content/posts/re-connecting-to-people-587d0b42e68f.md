Here’s some of the photos that I took during the 2015 Ozine Fest Anime Figure Special last Sunday in Mandaluyong.

I was really anxious if I will come inside, but if I didn’t took the risk, I won’t be much anxious as I am now. What I’m saying is that if I didn’t reconnect to the people I trust, I won’t be able to take a step towards forgiving myself.

Here are some photos as well — this time, I got cosplayers.

With that said, I’ll see you in a few events next year. I’m leaving you with this note — Uzuki Shimamura started back from square one all the way back to her current state, so I’ll do my best to do the same.
