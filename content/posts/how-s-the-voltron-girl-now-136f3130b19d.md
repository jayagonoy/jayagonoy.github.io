She’s been in numerous events before, when I was still starting to get a grasp of the Otaku culture. She’s been featured in [Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/5488480/seeing-the-littlest-cutest-voltron-of-them-all-made-me-melt) and [Kotaku](http://kotaku.com/5488004/voltron-does-not-get-any-more-adorable-than-this). [She even has a cameo](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=273833085973514&set=a.273397556017067.64996.120871391269685&type=3&theater). She’s Ashley Misaki before we saw Ashley Misaki.

Her name is **Belldandy Grimarez**. She’s been dubbed the ‘Voltron girl’ for one reason and one reason alone.

Nowadays, you won’t see her doing the usual Voltron girl skit, but when I got the chance to chat with her after the Bolen Lareza Chibi Cosplay competition, even though I forgot what she’s notable for, I took it.

So, where’s Belldandy now?

**Jay**: So, hi, Belldandy.  

**Belldandy**: Hello.  

**J**: So you’ve been out in the Cosplay scene for long. So, what happened?  

**B**: I started around 4 \[years old\], but nowadays I wasn’t able to Cosplay since I’m prioritising my studies. \[…\] but I still want to Cosplay as I miss it.

**J**: So, it’s been long, so I forgot to remember which characters you have Cosplayed \[I forgot that she IS the Voltron girl\], ‘no but your name is much memorable to me. At my time, I think around 2009 or 2010, you were in various competitions,and you were the talk of the town before, so how does that feel for you before and how it feels right now?  

**B**: My previous Cosplays?  

**J**: Yes.  

**B**: I feel just normal, since I Cosplayed for a long time. Nowadays, it’s ok; I really miss Cosplaying.

This author talks to the Voltron girl herself, all grown up.

**J**: So far, what changes do you see in the Cosplay \[community\] nowadays?  

**B**: For me, I am not able to attend \[events nowadays\], it’s just on this event \[Fantasm\] that I was able to attend; but I think it \[the Cosplay community\] became much better. I just can’t say how better it is.

**J**: When you were invited to the Bolen Lareza Chibi Cosplay Competition, what did you feel?  

**B**: I was happy; and then i was picked to be a judge. It’s my first time to judge as well. I’m happy. Also, the numbers \[the judges raise to score the participant\] is a bit confusing.

**J**: Is there anything else?  

**B**: For those who would like to try Chibi Cosplay, always do their best and pray before they perform on stage.

Long story short, as with any diligent child, she takes care of her studies first and she misses Cosplaying.
