> “(Hololive is) best-known for having one of the largest fan bases in VTubing — and their success in the industry attracts fans and potential talents to either join the agency or set up their own,” says Jay Agonoy, editor and publisher of the website VTuber NewsDrop.

> \[NewsDrop’s editor\] points out another difference in that, unlike with \[AKB48's Yasushi\] Akimoto, “Most English-speaking fans forgive Tanigo if Cover makes mistakes, as long as Hololive’s talents are treated well.” The support remains strong, even after a string of high-profile “graduations” (idol-speak for departures) from the agency. “You rarely see that kind of reverence toward other executives in this young VTuber industry.”
