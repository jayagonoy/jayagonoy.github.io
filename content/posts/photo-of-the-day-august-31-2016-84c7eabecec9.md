This was shared to me by friend and outgoing instructor Adrian Salonga. The post I did during my internship at Rappler, entitled “[Slow yet expensive PH Internet ‘not our fault’](https://rappler.com/moveph/slow-expensive-ph-internet-not-our-fault),” has been used as a source in our alma mater’s thesis done by IT students.

With the help of Move.PH, I relayed what LIRNEasia research fellow Ms. Grace Mirandilla-Santos said to the crowd at last year’s Youth Congress on Information Technology (Y4iT) at the SMX Manila. What she said there is the same thing that’s still happening now: There’s no real competition in the country’s ISP industry.

I was taking my time before August ends, and I will welcome September with this in mind. It’s been almost a year since Deremoe shuts down and I found myself losing my will to write — in fact, I was supposed to write a longer post tonight but decided to discard it because it’s not worth it.

I really want to meet the people who added me as a source — we’re from the same alma mater after all.
