It’s been a long time (not really, it’s been two years) since I got into [**Blogapalooza**](http://blogapalooza.ph/) — the first one I had is at SMX Aura in Taguig — and while the event’s got a bit smaller, it had great content compared to my previous visit in 2014.

For those who don’t have any idea about Blogapalooza, this event is basically the major blog con of the year — major, in terms of attendance: Even newbie bloggers are welcome here, and this is just one of the places where they can kick-start their blogs if they want to go full-time.

Too bad I missed the blogging panel done early in the program (I came in around 2 in the afternoon or so), but I liked two talks that were done there:

- **Strategic Blogger Relations** (Grace Bondad-Nicolas, TAG Media and Public Relations)
- **Video as Effective Marketing Tools** (Miguel Olfindo, New Media Factory)

I will leave you with some of the moments that I got inside this year’s event. I’ll be doing a separate post on the food that are offered inside. For now, see you in the next events.

Even Rappler.com has their own booth inside Blogapalooza. Their store is among some of the things that remind me of what Move.PH’s Zak Yuson (my supervisor during my internship there) has told me: “Rappler is a platform.”

Rappler, as we know it, is no longer just about news and social change— it now has their own Jobs and Coupons sections in partnership with different tech startups. Take note, I'm saying [Rappler **is** a tech startup](http://www.rappler.com/business/industries/133472-rappler-forbes-philippines-leading-startups).
