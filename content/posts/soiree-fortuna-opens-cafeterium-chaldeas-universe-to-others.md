After a long period of preparation which also passed through the pandemic lockdown, **Cafeterium Chaldeas** hosted its first major cosplay ball Soiree Fortuna at Pavilion de La Castellana in Intramuros, Manila last Sunday, December 3.

Soiree Fortuna welcomed cosplayers dressed up as characters not only from the namesake Chaldean dimension (Fate/Grand Order) but also from other franchises such as Genshin Impact, recognizing the immense popularity of both titles.

Soiree Fortuna is the third installment of Cafeterium Chaldeas, a group of day job professionals aiming to bring guests joy through organizing fun yet sustainable events. Originally organizing Fate-centric events, the group yearned to create fresh event formats where cosplayers can enjoy themselves together. Soiree Fortuna aimed to become a magical night for its guests to express their creativity, passion, and love for the community.
