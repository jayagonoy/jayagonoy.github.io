**REV Major**, the annual event for the fighting game community, returns for another run—this year, the event will be held at the SMX Convention Center Manila in Pasay City.

I've attended REV Majors before, especially the one at Solaire tent in 2019, and it's **fantastic**.

## Lots of Guests for REV Major 2023

This year's REV Major will have a lot of players from here and overseas gathered in one venue—in addition, they got **Rae Lil Black** and **Markman** as special guests.


## Giving players from far-flung places a chance

A series of tours called "Road to REV Major" have been conducted in Manila, Cebu and Davao to gather the best of the best fighting game players in major titles such as Street Fighter 6, Tekken 7, and Guilty Gear Strive.

Other activities inside REV Major include the Community Bay featuring [Killer Instinct](https://www.facebook.com/groups/364778754789403/posts/998396408094298/?__cft__[0]=AZWLe8qDQUwv2mOXgGFC2IoLXtQ5iZQw7xKwbhceeBHFKtN4fzr1VoyFsj5UGNMCfWzIePG8yYUi6gtH1XtfbfEPQWlwgHwRBdRlULGg9ZuEgCjJLDshiG5AU5Z8Olui2FTR8ghrWihJNnnrKhlbV9y1&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R), [Gundam EXVS](https://www.facebook.com/groups/exvsph/posts/1012534980166032/?__cft__[0]=AZWkxULkQvR3nPOJr5Dx0ZTvzOG95FjyZEdTL1pKyLDjCkBNuv00GauDutWZViccMiTvC9-lYITF89qCtxtYbHk7chp_f_zK4pHgXJ1_dd0ewL5w9UQL1Bmzjz5xHvXh-vipd1WdUSWOnt5yz8YhwoSfDLzy37aLAyEQbTNasZPgh5L48G0We4lCvifh-Uscn-A&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R), [Soul Calibur VI](https://www.facebook.com/cxEsports/posts/pfbid0j46yUaNo1rSeWTaqeGaKSRofeakMAdcaA8BwEG4y1q1YqcFbL9nuiNRypkYzTrr4l?__cft__[0]=AZVd7wXkjkacAueDKCV1Db35hsbnsN8NTcqlC8gG0fh-XeKDyFa4haV8bfDG2g93RvcO3Qa-L5VJaSW6LJ4yB4t8wECIcl7Eo2rTCBcFvPqjeAZ14pbsr7zaVxqfnfXkzLcufcHaXKuR0nA4sO-84C0x7n9Ku45y2f_Ngq61E_jv_7bLP870mT7O6IbZALOWsyk&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R), [NTR Gaming](https://www.facebook.com/ntrgamingph) and more.

## Why is REV Major a very important for the Fighting Game community?

- REV Major gradually made its way into the list of **[Tier 1 Tournaments](https://liquipedia.net/fighters/Tier_1_Tournaments)** in Liquipedia. I understand that the inclusion of some of the known FGC world tours contributed to this factor.
- Being a part of several world tours such as _Tekken World Tour_, _ArcSys World Tour_, _SNK World Championships_ and _DragonBall FighterZ World Tour_, REV Major gets the attention of the global FGC community (hence the long list of guests coming from overseas).
- With everyone gathered together, we expect wild moments become FGC history.

Going back to REV Major 2019, we were supposed to have a Melty Blood match that looks and feels like the ones I would definitely enjoy even if I wasn't a player. It almost happened...
