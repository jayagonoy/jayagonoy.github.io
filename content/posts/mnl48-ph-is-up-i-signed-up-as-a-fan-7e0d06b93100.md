It’s happening — or so I say, “IDZ HABBENING!”

After a long wait, we now have MNL48.ph online, and I will take a look at it in the coming days. The MNL48 mobile app was also launched earlier in the morning [as per the MNL48 Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/mnl48official/photos/a.961576910558265.1073741828.960380227344600/1148112051904749/?type=3).

Just this afternoon, AKB48 Team 8 had it’s second performance on ABS-CBN’s “It’s Showtime” prior to its appearance in the Japan-Philippines Friendship Anniversary Celebration with STARMARIE at Market! Market! BGC Taguig tomorrow afternoon.

Now that I’m in the site — let’s get the ball rolling as I will be one with the fans in monitoring MNL48 as it starts.

_I have my upcoming post on keepsakes. as well at around 9:30pm tonight, and it’ll be about food. Foooood. Catch you up later!_
