As long as you are a fan of anime idols, you are welcome here! Bring your love and passion for your anime oshi to the AiCon stage. Scouts (judges) will be present to determine whose star shines brightest, giving that idol-like vibe, which you only see in the stories you love.

The first two AiCons were held at the Bayanihan Center in Pasig City in January 2019 and March 2020, gathering hundreds of cosplayers, fans and aspiring idol groups. Whether you're a veteran of simulation arcade games or a budding mobile game fan, feel free to join the AiCon crowd for a one-day extravaganza.
