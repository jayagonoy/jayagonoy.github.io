The podcast has reached 90 episodes! I never realized that this side project of mine will end up like this. I'm expecting that I'll be able to reach 100 episodes this year, so I'll just keep a steady pace in producing episodes.

On this episode, I have with me Red Mendoza, who is wearing three hats, but I know him the most as an anime fan and a journalist.

Originally, we are to talk about a specific topic here. Since we're eternally at a state of nostalgia, given that we still can't hold anime/cosplay events physically [because of the pandemic](/covid19-diary-live-blog/), we then talked about his experience [covering the health beat](https://www.manilatimes.net/author/red-mendoza/).

It's been a year since he had me as a guest, so this time I'm returning the favor and have him tell his journey. Then we talk about his frustrations with local streaming providers as [we got one-upped by Singapore on this regard](https://www.facebook.com/redmendozaPH/posts/5124318804305139).
