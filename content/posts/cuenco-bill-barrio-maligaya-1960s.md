There are pieces of history which I am still not familiar with: Some of these include the legislation process of the **Religious Instruction Bill** (authored by Mariano Jesus Cuenco of Cebu) and **Barrio Maligaya**, both set in the 60s.

I was kind of familiar with Barrio Maligaya when I read a snippet of a story behind it during the pandemic. Seeing it adapted as a documentary film (for the second time - the first one was in the 80s) is beneficial for me to understand the first among the community development projects that my faith, the Iglesia ni Cristo, has established.

After "_Ang Paglisan_" (The Exodus) was screened just this afternoon, I was more interested in going to that specific place and see it for myself.

Back to the Religious Instruction Bill (which we will refer to as Cuenco Bill) - Having entered Catholic school to finish my elementary, I've seen what could be its effect to all public schools should it be passed. Even so, during my time in 3rd year high school, we had a subject about Religion whose instructor is a member of another Christian church.

That was the point "_Ipakipaglaban ang Pananampalataya_" it wants to share across its viewers after it was screened alongside the earlier film I mentioned.

As we are called by faith to rally for peace, this is a great time to look back at why my faith rallies on the streets as called. Here's [a summary](https://www.net25.com/news/national-rally-for-peace-isang-panawagan-para-sa-pagkakaisa-sa-enero-13) of why we are rallying again, years after the last one held at Shaw Boulevard, Pasig in 2015.
