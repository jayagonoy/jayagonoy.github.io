My latest trip to Cebu was last-minute, but it sure did lead me to another great event, which is Cebu Litfest 2023 at the Ayala Malls Central Bloc at the heart of Cebu IT Park. [I got a lot of cosplay photos on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.620416513426999&type=3), plus a video featuring my good friends Gary and Lloyd who covered the 6200 Geek Con and Otakufest last year.

Now for some photos that I'm sharing in this post: There was this one special booth where [Sharreh](https://www.facebook.com/sharrie.gail/posts/pfbid037pDcocgyQeY13r8T6Y7PSXZS6ga4syK9UtRGjxwXdGSk71RbizvLuFjntkynfqu6l) dressed up in traditional attire. Happy to know that hours after taking this photo, her merch are sold out!

Of course I'm in for VTuber merch—I got my _budol_ moment hours after recording footage from the event, and I brought home with me some good merch from [Jumpy Bun](https://mobile.twitter.com/JumpyBun/status/1620062736825876480/photo/2) and [Xero](https://mobile.twitter.com/buccigangg_/status/1621796613105807360). Guess which NijiEN prints I purchased from the artists!

I was present for one day only (Day 1), so I made it a point to capture as much cosplay photos as I can. Thankfully, the photos went well enough—and there are rare cosplays such as Nagumo from _Arifureta_:

The good ol' Genshin Impact featuring a rare Bonanus cosplay (rightmost)...

...and perhaps the only Quilldren on that day, a rare Ike Eveland cosplay.

I did not return back to Manila empty-handed, and it was a great experience to fly again to the Queen City of the South. I hope to do it again someday, for sure.
