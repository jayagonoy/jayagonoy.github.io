I have not written anything substantial in this space for a long time, so it's already time to whip up something special. Remember the time when I was roleplaying at three Fate/Grand Order theme cafes? _(Links below)_ I'm sorry to say that's the thing of the past, because at this time and age, _ang buong Pilipinas ay Genshin Impact._

Genshin Impact looked attractive because of its good character designs, catering to everyone's varied tastes. Events in the Philippines cannot escape the groups of Genshin Impact cosplays. I even got into a Genshin Impact maid cafe myself! ([Thanks, OtaCute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgmYCxuoAVE))

This year, I have listed two Genshin Impact fan events to be held in the next few months: [Genshin Mania PH's Cafe Teyvat](https://www.facebook.com/events/1385635145233365/?post_id=1385723391891207&view=permalink&__cft__[0]=AZXSZxffQ78zCer0ggFyZ83vaVU8i_TDkdukasiqkvqifZl44LVd7v0FFSrtWiRvY-KtaTupDGTjrHZVkydbP4NJGRs0dHS6uTXKb290tTtLB8enTHBGpZrUNZ3QAKfHyF4&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R) and [Primo Stella from The SVC and Pygmalia](https://www.facebook.com/primostella.ph/photos/a.105042388939410/105043382272644/). I've already reserved my slot for the Cafe Teyvat which is set to happen at Smile To Go Araneta City on August 14. Meanwhile, Primo Stella has just revealed its date and venue: November 19, 2022 at the Guadalupe Commercial Complex.

Perhaps the similarity between these two events is each venue's access to the Metro Rail Transit Line 3 (MRT-3 Araneta-Cubao and Guadalupe Stations). I'm just one month away from feeling the Teyvat experience - except that I have NOT yet played Genshin Impact at all, considered a sacrilege among the Genshin Impact elite (if there was one).

By the time you've seen this, Cafe Teyvat has concluded, so here's a quick vlog from the event:

There is also another fan event happening this October, organized by The Union for the benefit of Josefheim Foundation in Antipolo City, it's called "[An Interlude Between Journeys](https://www.facebook.com/events/423509136382586)," happening at 1588 Benitez Place in Manila on October 29. Those who have been to the second [Hypnosis Underground event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByKhNq9W-yY) should be familiar with the venue.

Now that I am back to blogging after ending my writing stint at Anime Corner (I am still finishing some commitments as I take a back seat), I promise no promises and let you know what's on my mind and what's happening in the community. Until then, I hope you come back here soon.
