TOYCON returns to the SM Megamall Megatrade Halls next weekend, July 8 to 10, 2022. Megatrade Hall served as home to TOYCON for a long time, before it moved to SMX Manila in 2016 as its audience grew bigger.

What does TOYCON's return to Megatrade mean to me? Memories—lots of memories. My first TOYCON was at the Megatrade, after all. Let's go back to 2010, when my older cousin and I visited its 9th edition. At that time, DC Comics was celebrating its 75th year; 2RATS, CSCENTRL and GamerTotoy exist; Encantadia was the hit TV series; [OTACOOL](https://dannychoo.com/archive/en/posts/otacool) was one of my dream books to collect; and I was just having fun. Those were good times.

Fast forward to 2017, I get to be part of the team servicing specific parts of the event, thanks to my current job at the events company. SMX Manila became home to TOYCON starting that year, and a large statue of Voltes V was displayed there. If there's one thing I remember about TOYCON at the moment, it's how it shows its love for the mecha series.

Fast forward to this coming weekend, Voltes V celebrates its 45th year anniversary, and the QUICCS V63 figure is going to be released at TOYCON. There's more to this year's event—let me pull the list for a sec:

Event partner Ambox gathers local idol groups past and present for its Aidoru Sekai 2022 segment. ASFIRE, Pastel Mix, Color Up Project, P7eiades, Bella6ix, URODIA, Starlight and MiQx are lined up to perform at the TOYCON stage. Please look forward to them.

Wrapping this up, prepare your comfiest shoes, your big and wide eco-bags, especially your wallet, for three days of toys, hobbies and collectibles. The 19th Philippine Toys, Hobbies and Collectibles Convention (TOYCON PH) happens from July 8 to 10, 2022 at the Megatrade Hall of SM Megamall in Mandaluyong City.

_I won't be roaming around too much since I'm going to be busy working, but I look forward to seeing you there regardless. Who knows, we can meet and I can share a piece of wisdom I learned from the events industry._
