Representatives from **Tokyo Game Show** were present in the Philippines last week to invite Filipinos to join the much-awaited annual gaming event this side of the world. Gamers, developers and the media were invited to know more about the Show and its benefits to the general gaming crowd, which is set to gather 250,000 visitors this year.

**Tokyo Game Show** is home to big reveals from major gaming consoles and game publishers, as well as the latest in independent gaming development, virtual/augmented reality, entertainment, peripherals and the like.

Their preview to Filipinos show that there is a need for adequate representation as only 11 countries in Asia and Oceania joined last year's show which gathered around 243,000 visitors across all of its days dedicated for businesses and the general public.

TGS also invites independent game developers to submit their game at its Selected Indie 80 segment to get a chance to share their game without exhibit fees at this year's event. This has captured the interest of local developers present. [Submissions](https://posting.nikkeibp.co.jp/form-cgi/formhtml.cgi?form=tgs_indie/index_en.html) are still open until April 30.

On the sidelines: TGS has rebranded its online-only VR segment into [Tokyo Game Show Digital World](https://events.nikkeibp.co.jp/tgs/2024/en/exhibitor/tgsdw/), featuring a virtual exhibition of select games in a separate VR world which can be browsed using an external program to be available soon.

This year's theme "Trailblaze the World with Gaming" will also have its largest and updated exhibit layout, focus on global exhibitors and visitors, and invites journalists and content creators to reach out to the publishers and test out games in person.

The four-day video game trade show and convention to be held at Makuhari Messe, Chiba from September 26 to 29 will have 12 areas: General Exhibition, Smartphone Game Area, Gaming Hardware Area, Gaming Lifestyle Area, AR/VR Area, eSports Area, Game Academy Area, Merchandise Area, Indie Game Area, Family Game Park, Business Solution Area and Business Meeting Area. In addition, there will be a pavilion featuring AI business solutions at Business Solutions Area.
