Our second podcast for the month of March features MaDe-paisen, a.k.a. Matthew Marcelo.

He's been coding for so long that when a comment on a Reddit board pissed him off so much, he had built the [Good VTuber Subs](http://twitter.com/goodvtubersubs) bot on Twitter.

This, among his other projects, shows how he is an "otaku for others."

This discussion talks about the recently-held [Fandom February](https://jayagonoy.com/informative-toushin-fandom-february-2021-every-fridays-of-the-month/) as well as the Good VTuber Subs in general.
