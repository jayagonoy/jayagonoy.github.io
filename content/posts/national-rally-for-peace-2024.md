I have yet to unload the photos I captured from last week's **National Rally for Peace** organized by the Iglesia Ni Cristo at the Quirino Grandstand. It's not the first time I spent time with the brethren at such a large gathering, but this one is unlike the last one I attended.

This post covers the early hours of the morning of January 13 all the way until the Rally concludes and everyone goes home. This event was already broadcast to the media, so I'll share more of my experience instead.

Aside from the main venue Quirino Grandstand (attended by a 1.5 million Church members - the numbers vary depending on who you asked), the rally was also held in 12 other locations across the Philippines.

I have several panorama photos to share along with you as I narrate my experience.

I prepared for the long days ahead as early as Sunday, in which I was able to attend the last few hours of Anime Fair at Ayala Malls Manila Bay. That night was great as I met good friends for nice discussions on VTubing (I picked up a handful of things from the conversation). I sent everyone off as I made good word with myself to be one of the last people to leave the mall before it closes.

Once that everyone's reached their homes, I started to have a long walk from the mall to Luneta, all while saving my phone's battery and musing myself in the process.

I landed at the Cultural Center of the Philippines Complex and dropped by a 7-Eleven at Star City. There I saw the growing number of brethren resting in preparation for the big day ahead. I was able to talk to fellow Church members who came from the provinces.

It's clear at this point that I joined the rally on my own, and I shared my thoughts about joining this rally this in [a previous post](https://jayagonoy.com/cuenco-bill-barrio-maligaya-1960s/).

After taking dinner at midnight, I went ahead and wished my fellows well, walking to the Grandstand. I dropped by the MBC Media Group office first and saw some of DZRH's fleet, some of which have Starlink attached.

I saw the part of Roxas Boulevard from the Complex all the way to Luneta restricted to vehicles, with the side-most lanes used as parking spaces for the incoming brethren. Some already came in advance, especially those from the provinces. Brethren from as far as Nueva Ecija and Pampanga have arrived in advance, already prepared as early as 1:00 am. Street vendors around the area vacate the vicinity of Roxas Boulevard covering both the Grandstand and Rizal Monument, giving way to the crowds.

I've reached Quirino Grandstand before 2:00 am, tired but relieved. My whole back touched grass, but I still need to get a sheet to rest easier. I slept for 4 hours, only to be waken up at 6:00 am as the crowds continue to gather. The air was cold, but thank God I rested well.

Coincidentally, January 13 is also the date of the first Stop and Salute Flag Ceremony, so I am excited to see the raising of the Philippine flag at the country's tallest flagpole, adjacent to Kilometer Zero.

While waiting at the center island along Roxas Boulevard adjacent to the flagpole and the Burnham Green, I saw two groups: IRL Livestreamers who were narrating their points-of-view, and those who introduced themselves as supporters of the Rally giving away water to participants. It's been established that the rally is open to the public to join, and they're welcomed with smiles.

The National Rally and the Flag Ceremony are separate events, and it was made obvious as both the organizing parties communicate along the way. The Rally gave way to the Flag Ceremony first. We just had a hiccup at one point (the Flag Ceremony also includes opening remarks from its participants) but overall the ceremonies kicked off peacefully.

It's not common that we Filipinos cheer after our Anthem has been sung, but you get that solemn feeling as we proceed to recite the Pledge of Allegiance to the Philippine Flag.

Rizal Park was opened to the public following the flag-raising ceremony, with most of the crowds taking photos at the Rizal Monument or setting up their picnic spots.

The actual program is scheduled to start at 4:00pm, which means I have 8 more hours to spend exploring the venue, charging my phone and resting. LED walls are set up along Kalaw Avenue, and South Road, so that those who cannot make it to the Grandstand can still see what's happening.

I spent time at a coffee shop nearby - obviously crowded with people taking their coffee or charging their phones at the outlets (I'm with the latter). By lunch time, I walked around and spotted mainstream media converging with the crowd as well.

After taking lunch at a canteen close to Kalaw Avenue, I saw other livestreamers (we commonly call them vloggers) commentating on the current situation. Then I met someone who came all the way from Quezon City, is past 50 years of age and have worked as a messenger throughout throughout the country.

The man, keenly interested in discussing politics, have shared his experiences with me, how he feels about the current state of politics, and his hopes for the future as he participates in the rally. We had a good talk before I let him go closer to the grandstand.

I took one more tour into the Grandstand, and when others say they feel like attending a concert before the program proper, believe them, for I also share their sentiments.

I would like to pause narrating my experience to give way to the actual program, which you can watch in full below:

Overall, the Rally with 1.8 million participants nationwide has been peaceful. The cleaning tools I saw being carried by some brethren in the morning have been made useful throughout the day, as we left the venue clean as we go. I carry home another core memory, something I'll tell others about in the future.

**Sidenote:** Some of the mediamen I've seen around the Rally area came from outlets like DWPM/Teleradyo Serbisyo/FM Radio, Abante Radyo, SMNI (yes), and ABS-CBN, alongside Net25 and INCTV. Oh there's also the one who owns the YouTube channel called Munting Kaalaman who went to the rally for himself (and I hope he enjoyed it).
