_This is my review of the first five episodes of the series as it airs in Japan at that time._

Looking back at the first five episodes of _The Devil is a Part-Timer!_ (_Hataraku Maou-sama!_), I’ve had a great experience so far. With this, here’s my thoughts on the series:

- I’ve enjoyed the dialogue between _Maou_ and the Hero _Emilia_ — there is something about these two that I can feel, but can’t explain. I’ll squeal if this series of dialogues will turn into definite romance, but taking consideration of the storyline, that won’t happen. I’ll stop thinking about Maoyu, I promise.
- I’m impressed with _Yoko Hikasa_‘s voice work as Emilia, and I feel that the voice range that she uses is quite similar to her role as _Houki_ in Infinite Stratos.
- Moving back to Emilia, I’m obsessed. Aside from she is a half-angel half-human, she works in a contact centres (of which I can definitely relate because I’ve worked at one). So beautiful.
- I would like to commend the original creator of the series for getting the surroundings real. For example, those computers that Emilia and her colleagues are using is almost the exact thing as what contact centres use; and the equipment Maou uses at the fastfood outlet is a no-brainer. In addition, it’s true that people working at contact centres are required to wear business outfits; but in the case of Emilia’s, she has a uniform, something that in under a case-to-case basis.
- I’m still amazed by the foreign language they use (referring to the _Ente Isla_ dialect) — was it a mix of European language rolled into one, they got it from a Western language? Certainly they won’t get an Eastern language for that. To my happiness, we can also speak the Ente Isla dialect ourselves, as [Croos in Random Curiosity](http://randomc.net/2013/05/04/hataraku-maou-sama-05/comment-page-1/#comment-971364) gave the cheat sheet.
- Maou’s experience as a slave (for a lack of word) to the work-force has changed his perspective, so as _Ashiya_ (_Alsiel_)’s experience as a houseman. To push it further, they are changed to a point that they are adding a comic relief in the whole story dialogue. Thus, I find some scenes in the recent episodes funny than what it supposed to be.

With that said, I’m going to watch this further. This might be the series that will give me a sleeper hit. Excuse me if I’ll have to speak in their language, but I say, “Lonv lige Paou-japa.”
