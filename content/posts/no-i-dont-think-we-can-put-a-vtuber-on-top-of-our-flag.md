Only a few thought to put VTubers in their flags:

Imagine if we can put our own VTubers in our own Philippine flag, right? **Impossible.**

The Flag & Heraldic Code of the Philippines ([Republic Act 8491](https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1998/02/12/republic-act-no-8491/), approved February 12, 1998) was clear, we cannot do that:

> **SECTION 34.** It shall be prohibited  
> \[...\] f. To add any word, figure, mark, picture, design, drawings, advertisements, or imprint of any nature on the flag;

In other words, the law prohibits us to put images of VTubers over the Philippine flag. If this idea worked in other countries, it's not allowed here.

**Call me killjoy** but the same applies with the [Canadian flag](https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/campaigns/national-flag-canada-day/about/do-dont-flag.html), I just learned\*. Or with [Indonesia](https://peraturan.bpk.go.id/Details/38661/uu-no-24-tahun-2009).

\* Kari, a Canadian, [pointed out](https://x.com/kari_chary/status/1825261412555559278) after I posted this piece that _"the rules for the flag arenâ€™t actually laws, but rather suggestions - violating them is not illegal and people modify the flag in all sorts of ways when they display it in Canada."_

Not sure about the other flags posted above, because the [UK Flag](https://www.flaginstitute.org/wp/uk-flags/british-flag-protocol/#index2) doesn't specify anything important in this matter. No one has been convicted of desecrating the US Flag either because _[United States v. Eichman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Eichman)_ made it unconstitutional to penalize such. **So maybe we can put VTubers in the US or UK flags.**

**Key Takeaway: Check your local flag laws before putting any VTuber in it.** Wikipedia has a [summary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_desecration) on Flag Desecration laws.

Laws, I know, sometimes it takes away the fun, but the guidelines are written for a reason.
