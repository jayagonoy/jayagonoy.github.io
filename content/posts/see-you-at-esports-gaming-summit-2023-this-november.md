**Esports and Gaming Summit 2023** established itself to be a major hub for the gaming scene in the Philippines. In the past, it has hosted esports brands from major tech companies like Acer (Predator), ASUS (Republic of Gamers) and MSI. Last year's edition has SEGA (Atlus) and Riot Games (League of Legends).

This year, they are celebrating their 10th year edition by hosting the event at the World Trade Center Metro Manila, which is also a host to several major exhibitions.

On this post, we are about to answer the following questions:

- **What should we look forward to at this year's ESGS?**

- **Who will be attending ESGS 2023?**

- **How do I get to ESGS 2023?**

## **What should we look forward to at this year's ESGS?**

ESGS was first established in 2014 by organizer Gariath Concepts as an event for the gaming community, something it continues to give their commitment. This year's event is set to be held on the weekend of November 3-5 (Friday to Sunday).

Look forward to the offerings from partner brands such as Globe Telecom, Samsung, JBL Quantum, Riot Games, Republic of Gamers, MSI, Tecno Mobile, RUMBLE ROYALE, Lenovo, LG Electronics, Bandai Namco Entertainment Asia and others.

Co-presenter Globe Telecom is going all-out in its offerings to all attendees of Esports and Gaming Summit 2023.

“Globe customers attending the event can expect exclusive perks such as a 5% discount on tickets, 10% discount on ESGS merchandise, an opportunity to win a 3-day pass by redeeming Globe Rewards points on GlobeOne app an express lane for attendees displaying a registered Globe SIM card, and complimentary GET bus shuttle services between the World Trade Center and three specific Ayala Malls”, says Mark Singson, Subcultures Manager for Gaming and Anime for Globe Telecom.

“There will also be a grant tailored for a standout game developer, cosplayer, or game merchant.”

We'll have more details about Globe's offerings later in this post.
