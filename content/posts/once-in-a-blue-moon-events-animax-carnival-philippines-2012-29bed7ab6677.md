After being held in numerous places outside the Philippines, Animax finally decides to have their Carnival here, and in Manila. Albeit the disappointment due to the sound systems, the loss of my bet Maronne Cruz (of which I’ll talk about later on this post) and things that I have no control of outside the event, this is a great once-in-a-blue-moon event you shouldn’t have missed — **your regrets if you have missed this**.

Let me start with the cons of this event — I still do not know why in the world they have to do this at such place called the Midtown Atrium of Robinsons Place Ermita. Are they expecting that the floor size is fit for the attendees? Wait, scratch that — there are free spaces surrounding the area, so I guess it’s not a con at all. I think that there are no cons at all, dear readers.

Moving on to the pros, I appreciate the fact that one of the masters of ceremony has experience in Anime — his name is Apollo, and he lent his voices to some _Dragon Ball Z_ characters since the times it aired on the good old RPN 9. The other one is a DJ from local RX 93.1 named Karen Bordador.

I also appreciate that Animax surprised me when it said that it will be available on the local Cignal Digital TV by next year — yes, this guy which is not subscribed to Cignal is squeeing over the fact that Animax [will be going to Cignal](http://www.facebook.com/AnimePH/posts/461711753885360). Not to mention that this is the first time Animax will be on two cable systems after a decade or so. The last update I got is that Animax is only available to SKYcable prior to that.

Next up is the Q4 2012 to Q1 2013 releases — _Hyouka_, _Chihayafuru_, _Accel World_, _Fullmetal Alchemist Movie: The Sacred Star of Milos_, _Hayate the Combat Butler: Heaven is a Place on Earth_, _Fafner: Dead Agressor: Heaven and Earth_. Not to mention new episodes of _Fairy Tail_ and _Bleach_. “Blargh. Stahp. Too many for my anime digestion.” **Don’t tell me you won’t say that.**

Cosplayers. You won’t miss any of my Cosplayer Interviews, for goodness sakes.

Finally, the Ani-Mates Search. I had once this prediction that it’s a fight between either Team Orz member _Maronne Cruz_ and English-fluent _Rhianna Floresca_. Guess what, Rhianna won — and as AnimePH says, it’s “[Tears of Joy](http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=461715447218324&set=a.161488063907732.36681.161458020577403&type=1).”

I was not able to get an interview with Rhianna but here’s what her close friend says about:

To sum it up, as what I have said before, you’ll regret the time you did not come here at Animax Carnival Philippines 2012… that is, if they will have another one next year.
