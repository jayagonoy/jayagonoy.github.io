## Brief Profile

Jay has written feature stories for websites such as [The Reimaru Files](https://www.reimarufiles.com/?s=jay+agonoy) and [Rappler](https://www.rappler.com/?q=%22Jay+Agonoy%22#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=%22Jay%20Agonoy%22&gsc.page=1), as well as moderated select panel discussions on the local anime and idol cultures. Currently, he heads the industry news website [VTuber NewsDrop](https://vtubernewsdrop.com/author/jay), founded in 2022.

## Full Profile

Being an anime/cosplay fan, I share stories from within our community. This started with [Deremoe](https://www.youtube.com/@deremoe) in 2010, with _keepsakes._ in 2016, and continues with VTuber NewsDrop. I am an active visitor of Japanese pop culture events in the country, going in as far as Cebu, Davao, Baguio, and (at one time) Singapore to understand each of its communities.

I rarely participate in campus activities as I was pursuing a blogging career in college. My internships over at three media outlets, namely Manila Standard, the (Philippine) Presidential Broadcast Service, and Rappler, helped me understand the inner workings of the media business.

I also applied and qualified for speaking engagements at the Philippine Blogging Summit ([iBlog](http://iblogph.org)) twice, first with "[Avoiding Information Redundancy](https://speakerdeck.com/JayAgonoy/avoiding-information-redundancy)" (2013) and "[Sharing Beyond Your Blog](https://speakerdeck.com/jayagonoy/sharing-beyond-your-blog)" (2017). 

My recent talks are about Virtual YouTubers, which I believe to be the next frontier in online entertainment alongside the stremaer culture:  "[VTuber Security](https://speakerdeck.com/jayagonoy/vtuber-security-2023)" (2023), "[Communicating with the Media as a VTuber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJIW9Se8Yjg&t=8s)" (2024). I moderate panel discussions on Idol Culture and VTubers as well ("[VTuber Burnout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwHr6N1yiek)," 2025).

I've also attended the [15th International Conference on Japanese Studies](http://ateneojspconference.blogspot.com/2014/11/manga-and-manga-esque-new-perspectives.html) hosted by the Ateneo de Manila University, as well as the 1st De La Salle University Communication Conference, both held in 2015.

My first international panel talk was held at Kurocon Online Vol. 2, titled "[Case Studies on YouTube-based Anime Distribution Model in Southeast Asia](https://speakerdeck.com/jayagonoy/case-studies-on-youtube-based-anime-distribution-model-in-southeast-asia)."

I have a brief writing stint with Back2Gaming.com, sharing my anime reviews with them under a pseudonym. In my free time, I also got to participate in the [The Reimaru Files](https://www.reimarufiles.com/?s=jay+agonoy)' RFTalk series, leading to a dedicated series called "Events Circuit Preview."

Prior to _keepsakes._, I also produced side-projects including Anicredits (ready-to-copy credits for anime series), LIA (a mapping project which indicates the places where municipal ordinances are posted), and KOYAJ (featuring mashups of select anime tracks available for playback on Soundcloud). Anicredits and LIA are archived on GitHub.

As a Rotarian for close to 8 years, I have provided visual materials for the Rotary Club of Mutya ng Pasig, and eventually became its club president (Rotary Year 2022-2023, _Imagine Rotary_) until I left the civic service organization in early 2024.

In addition, I had practiced amateur radio and participated in a few group meetings over the air (HAM calls) for a brief period of time.

My interests range from the Internet, photography, videography, branding, data privacy, podcasting, smooth jazz, lite rock, and vaporwave.
